<h1>Author's Preface</h1>

<p>There appears to be a gap in the quantitative understanding of urban studies and architecture. Without the ability for quantitative understanding, these disciplines will remain stagnant in the pre-scientific stage, a situation that brings confusion and mental waste to students. This work attempts to provide some modeling and quantitative simulation for urban studies and architecture to help understand these fields.</p>

<p>Many key variables in urban/architectural studies are related to geography, transportation, technology, politics, and especially costs. Cost is a core selection factor. The cost mentioned here does not refer to construction costs, but includes all aspects of the economic cost concept, including transaction costs, opportunity costs, etc. Therefore, algorithms for urban studies and architecture are multidisciplinary. Moreover, the starting point of a problem is often not the traditional architectural starting point.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Urban scales from large to small are in positive order, architectural scales from small to large are in negative order, converging at point 0. This work does not attempt to cover all aspects of urban studies and architecture, but rather conducts modeling and simulation at several scales, hoping to cover a number of common or important issues.</p>
