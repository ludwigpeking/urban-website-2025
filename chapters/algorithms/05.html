<h1>05. Urban Site Selectionâ€”Agricultural City: Irrigated Land Density, Drainage Slope</h1>

<h2>Concepts</h2>

<h3>Agricultural City</h3>
<p>Cities that rely on agricultural surplus from surrounding hinterlands to generate division of labor and support advanced organizations.</p>

<h3>Irrigated Land Density</h3>
<p>Irrigated land appears in areas with gentle slopes; with adequate local precipitation or insufficient local precipitation but accessible rivers that can be utilized. If the slope is too steep, or higher than the river level, high-density irrigated land cannot appear. Particularly low-lying terrain is prone to flooding, which is unfavorable for agriculture, but the development of hydraulic technology can address this problem to some extent.</p>

<h3>Hydraulic Technology</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, it is primarily related to the ability to transform low-lying terrain into irrigated land.</p>

<h3>Drainage Slope</h3>
<p>Cities on flat land have lower transportation costs, but on excessively flat and low-lying land, they are easily threatened by floods.</p>

<h3>Flood Risk</h3>
<p>Low-lying topography has high flood risk. Additionally, the upstream watershed area is also a factor. If the watershed area is small, the risk of low-lying topography is also manageable.</p>

<h3>Collection Distance</h3>
<p>Collection costs include management and transportation, beyond distance considerations.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using real topographic maps to analyze key variables. The analysis method is quite complex. Simplified to three variables: low-lying degree, irrigated land density, and collection distance.</p>
