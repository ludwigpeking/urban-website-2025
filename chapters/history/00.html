  , which is originally in Mandarin language and is purposely serialized to
  later become a book on urbanism, which is temporarily named<em>
    [<strong>An Evolutionary History of the City</strong>]</em
  >. It underscores the self-organizational, bottom up generative aspects of the
  city and its problem awareness is set against the backdrop of contemporary
  China, where the convergence of 1) discourse and ideology that favors
  top-level design with 2) the needs of interest groups to seize wealth and
  power has resulted in highly authoritative urban mega-planning and
  irreversible damage to the built environment due to 3) professional
  malpractice. Nevertheless this work creates a few arguments/analyses on the
  broader history of urbanity, which the author expects to be innovational or
  even useful in the understanding and the <em><strong>modeling</strong></em> of
  urbanism.

  The content is in the process of being reorganized and refined to meet
  academic standards, 12 more chapters are to be added for a preliminary
  completion. The Author is working on re-writing/editing it in English, in
  order to improve its readability in English context. Various media,
  illustrations, charts and videos, are being created to make the work
  eventually visualized/animated.
