<p>
  Beginning with this chapter, I will give a series of lecture on viewing cities
  from an evolutionary perspective.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Biological communities and economic systems are commonly understood as
  evolutionary. This notion extends to areas including computer algorithms,
  linguistics, aesthetic trends, Earth's geomorphology, and the universe's
  structure, all analyzed as evolutionary systems.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  However, the city - a place where everyone lives their daily lives, and an
  obvious evolutionary system - is often seen as a product of human design, and
  is thought to be something drawn out of a blueprint. So much so that the
  discipline of studying cities is called ‘urban planning’ or ‘urban design’
  acknowledging a prevailing assumption that cities are products of deliberate
  planning and design.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Adhering to this viewpoint, however, can obscure a deeper comprehension of
  urban dynamics. And those in power keep creating hideous cities based on their
  arbitrariness.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  And if you give up the urge to plan and instead examine the city as an
  evolving system, you will dramatically increase your opportunity to
  systematize and structure urban knowledge. The knowledge gathered from this
  approach often has stronger explanatory power, making it useful for diagnosing
  a city's problems or predicting its future trajectory. Pioneered by Charles
  Darwin and Friedrich Hayek, great scholars like Richard Dawkins, Stewart
  Brand, and Michael Batty have also contributed to this discourse.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The ancestors of whales and sharks had significant differences, yet they
  evolved similar physical forms due to their similar habitats and occupying
  similar ecological niches. This analogy extends to urban environments, where
  cities may evolve comparable structural features in response to similar
  environmental pressures. In the following paragraphs, I will provide
  <b>three examples </b>to further illustrate this concept.

<p><strong>Kaminarimon Gate，Tokyo</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Those who have visited Sensoji Temple in Tokyo may remember a long, narrow
  street that stretches between the temple's main gate and the Kaminarimon Gate.
  This street is ‘over 200 meters long and about 7-8 meters wide, with a column
  of small shops on either side, 54 on the east and 35 on the west’ (Asakusa
  Nakamise Shopping Street Association 2008), permanent and prestigious, but
  similar to the setting of temporary stalls in a flea market. You can weave
  through the gaps between these shops to get to the back of the stores. Behind
  each row of shops, there is a street that runs parallel to the central street,
  and along the outer street, there are shops that have a more classical
  appearance. All three streets have shops, parallel to each other, leading from
  the Kaminarimon Gate to the temple.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  It is evident that this thoroughfare was originally an expansive avenue,
  extending over 20 meters in width, deliberately designed to lead to the
  temple, embodying a monumental grandeur. Architecturally speaking, it
  possessed a significant commemorative and monumental character. On festival
  days, the avenue teemed with a multitude of pilgrims and worshippers, lending
  it a vibrant atmosphere, and concurrently, numerous vendors capitalized on
  this influx by setting up stalls for commercial gain.
</p>
<p>
  Looking into the history record (23 Special Wards of Tokyo Council official
  record), the right of running stalls were originally granted to the group to
  take the duty of cleaning the temple precinct. A strategic question arises:
  where would these stalls be optimally positioned? Logically, they would not be
  located directly in the center of the avenue, as this would impede the direct
  path of the pilgrims towards the temple, necessitating the maintenance of a
  sufficiently wide passageway. Additionally, positioning stalls in front of the
  permanent storefronts lining the avenue would obstruct customer access, thus
  requiring the preservation of an unobstructed pathway for these
  establishments. Consequently, the stalls were predominantly situated slightly
  off-center, either to the left or right of the avenue's midpoint.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<img src="./img/0108.jpg" alt="" class="middle-diagram" />

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  (Figures above: the pilgrimage passage over time. Top: original passage in
  early Edo Era. Middle: late Edo Era. Bottom: modern era.)
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  This arrangement, borne out of practical necessity, was proven over time not
  to disrupt the flow of the pilgrimage. Interestingly, these temporary stalls
  garnered remarkable commercial success, surpassing the established shops
  flanking the avenue. This raises the question of potential commercial harm to
  the permanent storefronts. However, this was not the case. The introduction of
  these stalls intensified the avenue's competitive commercial environment,
  enhancing the shopping experience by offering greater convenience and
  affordability. This transformation elevated the avenue's status as a paramount
  destination for belief, tourism, and shopping. Despite the partial obstruction
  and diminished visibility caused by the stalls, and the diversion of some
  business, the established shops benefited significantly from the augmented
  pedestrian traffic, ultimately witnessing an increase in overall profits.
</p>

<p>
  Furthermore, the temple, being the proprietor of the avenue, capitalized on
  this evolution by collecting fees from the stall vendors and eventually
  institutionalizing the presence of these stalls. Through these evolutionary
  changes, this avenue, located at the forefront of the temple, emerged as one
  of Tokyo's most illustrious temple fair streets.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In the process of transformation, it is conceivable that contradictions,
  conflicts, and adjustments were prevalent. For instance, there were instances
  where stalls were set up exceedingly close to the center, impeding traffic
  flow. Additionally, certain stalls completely obstructed the entrances of
  established shops, adversely affecting their business operations. However,
  after a period of negotiation and adaptation, all parties involved on the
  street eventually reaped benefits. The central roadway was reduced to 8 meters
  in width, naturally not as conducive for movement as the original expanse of
  over 20 meters, but it remained sufficiently functional.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Should one singularly emphasize the transit efficacy of this street, it is
  indeed apparent that it has diminished. However, the majority of the street's
  users and stakeholders have acknowledged and accepted this transformation.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  One can imagine certain individuals who never utilized these small stalls,
  such as authoritative figures like the Shogun. Hypothetically, if the Shogun,
  while passing through the Kaminarimon, had noticed these stalls and remarked
  on their detrimental effect on the cityscape, and if the temple authorities
  had acquiesced to his wishes by dismantling the stalls, the result would have
  been a much wider but mundane street. Such a scenario did not happen on the
  Shogun, contrarily, upon the municipal authorities assuming control over the
  temple's rights in 1885, the entire commercial street was demolished,
  resulting in significant losses for the vendors. Hence, it is observed that
  the arbitrary and forceful actions of a democratically elected government are
  not necessarily less arbitrary than those of a feudal ruler. Fortuitously, the
  commercial street, owing to its traditional economic value, was soon restored
  and continues to thrive to this day.

<p><strong>Ponte di Rialto, Venice</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<img src="./img/0107.jpg" alt="" class="middle-diagram" />
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(Figure above: from Salvatore Russo, 2016)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The next example is in Venice, which has a unique transportation system
  consisting of both water and land routes. The land system consists of many
  connected alleys and bridges . The most important bridge here is, without a
  doubt, the Rialto Bridge on the Grand Canal. Before the 19th century, it was
  the only bridge over the Grand Canal in Venice. The bridge connects the market
  and two of Venice's central districts.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The beautiful arches on the bridge might create a misconception that they
  meant to provide shelter for pedestrians. But actually only shops are under
  the roof of the colonnades. Between these shops, the pedestrian passage is
  contrarily open to the air. Further details are omitted here; however, these
  rows of shops bear resemblance to the stalls at the Kaminarimon shopping
  street. They divide the wide bridge deck into three parallel passages.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<img src="./img/img_0150.jpg" alt="" class="middle-diagram" />
<img src="./img/img_0451.jpg" alt="" class="middle-diagram" />
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  (Figures above: compared 12th century wooden Rialto Bridge, with shops on its
  deck, and modern Rialto Bridge, with shops more pronounced by its colonnade.
  by the author 2023)
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The significant pedestrian traffic on the bridge greatly contributed to the
  success of its shops. These shops were also a key part of the bridge's
  architectural design, becoming prominent visual features. The inclusion of
  these shops was planned during the bridge’s reconstruction in 1591, and this
  aspect has been maintained since then. This design choice, however, was not
  necessarily due to the foresight of the architects. Originally, there was a
  wooden bridge in this location, which initially had no shops. Maintaining a
  wooden bridge required funds, and while collecting tolls was a straightforward
  option, the Venetian authorities decided to construct shops on the bridge,
  using the rent from these shops for maintenance. This approach proved to be
  more beneficial than just collecting tolls, embedding commercial activity into
  the bridge’s identity. This integration of shops became a lasting tradition,
  so much so that when the wooden bridge was replaced with a stone bridge, this
  commercial element was preserved. The Rialto Bridge is more than just a
  transportation link in Venice; it has become a self-supporting entity
  combining mutual benefits and functionality (Dupré, Judith 2017).
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  This concept of combining commercial spaces with bridge structures was not
  unique to Venice, rather it was a quite common practice. Other notable
  examples include Florence's Ponte Vecchio and London Bridge, which, before the
  19th century, not only hosted a market but also had residential spaces above
  it (Pierce, Patricia 2001).

<p><strong>Chien Men Avenue, Beijing</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Imperial China has often been viewed as traditionally more autocratic and less
  friendly towards the free market. However, there is an example that suggests
  that at some point in time, the traditional authorities could be more tolerant
  towards spontaneous activities, even more than the modern ones. This example
  is the Chien Men Avenue in Beijing, which is the 30-meter-wide axial street in
  front of the Forbidden City.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  If one visits Chien Men Avenue today, they will find a small street on each
  east and west side, located behind the shops along the main street. The street
  on the west is called Jewelry Street, and the one on the east is called Fruit
  Alley. They are parallel to Chien Men Avenue and form a system of three
  parallel roads. When I visited it in 2017, I immediately realized that this
  could be a result of informal occupation on a once broader avenue. I later
  find its evidence:
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The original Chien Men Avenue was a 60-meter-wide monumental avenue. As it
  served not only as the front door of Beijing but also as the route for the
  emperors to the Temple of Heaven to offer sacrifices. As early as the late
  Ming Dynasty, there were already many temporary shacks on Chien Men Avenue,
  which formed two columns of continuous shacks. 'Notes from Hongyi Pavilion,'
  recorded an incident that occurred at Chien Men during the late Ming Dynasty.
  It states, 'In front of Beijing's Front Gate, shelters were erected and
  occupied as shops, a practice long established.' In the seventh year of the
  Chongzhen Emperor's reign, the residence of a royal, Zhu Chunchen, was
  destroyed by fire on a festival day. Consequently, the city's officials
  demolished all the shelters that encroached upon the official street and
  obstructed the roadways, for they hindered the fire fighting. In response to
  this event, Imperial Attendant Jin Guangchen immediately petitioned the
  Emperor, stating: 'The capital's impoverished residents, who rent shelters
  without means, barely eke out a living through trade, their professions meager
  and their plight pitiable.' He argued that the wholesale demolition of these
  shelters was inconsiderate of the hardships of separation. He further
  questioned: 'If a fire spreads to a shelter, should we then destroy all
  shelters, just as if it spreads to an inner chamber, should we also destroy
  all inner chambers?' Following this memorial, the Emperor, deeming the
  argument reasonable, halted the demolition of the Chien Men shelters,
  preserving the existing structures.（ Gao Yongyan, Zhu Yizun, 1687）

<p>
  Over time, the passage between the two columns of shacks has become the main
  street of Chien Men Avenue. These shacks have gradually become more valuable
  and turned into permanent shops, housing many luxurious stores. Meanwhile, the
  original edge of the street, the part behind the shacks, has become two alleys
  mainly housing small shops that sell daily supplies.What is more interesting
  is, in an old photo around 1900, the guards of honor of Emperor Guangxu and
  Empress Dowager Cixi were returning to the Forbidden City through the Chien
  Men Avenue after the Boxer Incident subsided. In the photo, there were two new
  columns of stalls in the already narrowed avenue. Another round of informal
  occupation has taken place. The left right of way was being eroded. This wave
  just did not get formalized. But, if we view the photos of the Avenue in time
  sequence, we realize it is gradually narrowed, until the modern municipality
  entered the history, and trolley bus was introduced.

<div><strong>Remarks</strong></div>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The three examples of Tokyo's Kaminarimon, Venice's Rialto Bridge, and
  Beijing's Chien Men Avenue can be considered isomorphic. Each involves
  introducing stalls into pre-designed passageways, a form of temporary or
  informal occupation. Over time, these adaptations evolve into new traditions,
  transforming the original street layouts. This evolution results from
  negotiations and a balance of interests among various stakeholders, coupled
  with authority tolerance. These stakeholders include:
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<ul>
  <li>
    Through Traffic: likes the spaciousness of the passage, dislikes the shacks’
    narrowing the passage; but in case there are services provided, he/she may
    join the shoppers, and benefit from it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Shopper: likes the convenience/affordability provided by the commercial
    activity; hates the disorder of poorly organized setting; hates also the
    elimination of the activity.

  <li>
    Business owners:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Original street frontage owner: likes the economic gains from the
        traffic, likes to push the frontage closer to the traffic; hates
        objects, shacks blocking his frontage; but likes the traffic attracted
        by other businesses.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shack operator: likes to take advantage of the traffic, will try to be
        at the point of most traffic; like to formalize his claim; fears the
        hatred by the original owners and purposeful travelers and the
        relinquishment of his establishment due to public or authoritative
        sentiment;

      </li>
      <li>
        Bureaucrat: likes the ‘good’ appearance, likes to be politically
        correct, as being fair, being cautious; hates hazards, conflicts and
        chaotic appearance.
      </li>
      <li>
        Autocratic ruler: favors tax and prosperity; dislikes the reduction of

  The process is a complex game among all parties, each individual would act to
  maximize his own interests, but is countered by other parties. It is an
  accumulation of the decisions made by all the individuals over time, although
  each of them may have different weight. Good practice arises from a balanced
  situation, where traditions regulate the behavior of the participants, and
  intentional organization might invent or reinvent the traditions.

  driving force behind these processes is human nature, desire, and behavior
  patterns, and the self-evolving structure of cities is universal and

<p>The original lecture in Chinese :</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>01 同構三名勝——做为演化系统的城市</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>从这期开始，我搞一个从演化的视角看城市的讲座。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>生物群落，大家一般都知道他是一个演化系统。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  经济系统，也被当做演化系统来被认知。除此之外，计算机算法、人类的语言、审美偏好、地球表面的地形地貌、甚至宇宙的大尺度结构，这些都被当成演化系统来研究。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  但是，城市——一个每个人日常生活的场所，一个非常明显的演化系统——却经常被当成人的意志的创造，被认为是用蓝图画出来的东西。以至于研究城市的学科，被称为“城市规划“或者“城市设计”。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>仿佛城市被规划、被设计是理所当然的。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  沿着这种思路，人很容易失去理解城市的机会。
  或者，权力者，会从个人的意志为出发点，制造很多蹩脚的城市。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  而如果你放弃规划的冲动，反过来把城市当成一个演化系统来考察，那你把城市知识化和结构化的机会陡增，而且从中汇聚起来的知识，也往往具有更强的解释能力。用于诊断一个城市的问题，或者预测一个城市的进程。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  鲸鱼和鲨鱼的祖先差异非常大，确具有形态上的相似，这是它们在类似的环境中生活，并且占据了类似生态位的结果。类似的环境，也会推动城市向类似的形态去演化。下面我提供三个场所作为例子。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  雷门：去过东京浅草寺的人可能会记得，寺院的大门和大街上的雷门之间，有一条长长的小街，200多米长，大概七八米宽，左右两侧是连成列的一间间小小店铺，，其尺寸就像自由市场的临时摊位。你可以通过这些店铺间的缝隙，绕到店铺的背后，你会发现，左右两列店铺的背后，各有一条街。和中间的街平行，沿着外侧的街道，是看起来更加古典的店铺。这三条街，都有店铺，平行的，从雷门通向寺院的大门。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  很显然，这条街，原本是一条20多米宽的大街，是专门通向寺庙的，非常宏伟，用建筑学的术语说，非常Monumental，具有纪念性。在节日的时候，这里进香参拜的人很多，很热闹，也会有很多人来摆摊赚钱。摆摊的时候，你会在哪里摆摊呢？答案是你不会堵在路的正中间，因为大家要直直的朝寺庙走过去，而且你要留下一条比较宽的通道；同时，你又不能挡住大街边的固定商家的门脸，所以你要给他们留下一个通道，让顾客可以自由进出；所以，只能在街中间偏左或者偏右的地方摆摊。久而久之，实践证明，这种摆摊方式，不会影响参拜的交通。小摊位的生意非常火爆，超过了原来街两侧的商店；这是不是对这些商店的损害呢？没有。由于有了这些小摊位，这条街的竞争更加充分，购物更加方便实惠，成为了一个非常重要的观光和购物目的地，虽然这些商店一定程度上被摊位阻挡了，损害了他们的展示效果，甚至他们的生意被小摊位超过了，但是他们从人流的增加上得到了充分的好处。整体看他们的收益比原来更多。这条街道的所有者，寺院本身，可以收取摆摊人的摊位费。甚至将这些摊位永久化。这条寺庙前的大街，经过了这样一番改变，就形成了东京最著名的一条庙会街。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  我们可以想象，在改变的过程中，有矛盾，有冲突，有调整。比如，曾经有人摆摊非常靠近中心，阻挡了交通。还有摊位彻底堵死了固定商店的大门，影响了人家的生意。但是经历了一些时间的协调和磨合，这条街道上的各方都实现的获益。中间的道路变成了8米，当然不如原来20多米走起来痛快。但是勉强用，也足够了。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  你如果片面的强调这条街的通行效果，通行效果确实下降了。但是，这条街的绝大多数使用者和利益相关者，认可了这种改变。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  你可以想象，有些人是从来不用这些小摊的，比如将军大人。假如有一天他老人家，走过雷门，发现这些小摊，说“太破坏市容市貌了”。如果寺庙的人乖乖的听他的话，把小摊都拆掉。那么你今天得到的将是一条宽得多，但是意义平淡的多的街道。但是这种情况并没有发生。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  如果你认为这种对小摊贩的宽容是现代化很晚的日本特有的，那么，我给你举一个中世纪到近代最富裕的欧洲城市，威尼斯的例子。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  威尼斯的交通，分为水陆两个系统，其中路上的系统是很多小街道和桥串联起来的。这里面最重要的一座桥，那么毫无疑问，是大运河上的Rialto&nbsp;里亚尔多桥。在19世纪之前，这是威尼斯大运河上唯一的一座桥。这座桥连接着市场和威尼斯最主要的两个区。你看这座桥上有优美的拱廊，你以为它是给行人遮风挡雨的吗？
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>不是的，实际上拱廊有左右两列，拱廊下面是两列店铺。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  因为我前面已经讲过了浅草寺的步行街，这里我也就不再赘述，这两排店铺，就相当于雷门里面的摊位。它们把宽阔的桥面分割成平行的三条通道。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在人来人往的主桥上，这些店铺从商业地产的角度上当然是非常成功。而且，它们还得到建筑设计上的强调，成为桥上最醒目的视觉元素。难道，建桥的时候，建筑师就有先见之明，建了这些店铺吗？答案是：确实，这些店铺，从1591年这座桥建成之前就设计好了，并且一直存在到现在。但是它也不是出于什么设计者的先见之明。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  事实上，在它之前，这里曾经是一个木头桥。这座木头桥上，最开始是没有店铺的。但是，维修木头桥是要花钱的，为了收集修桥的经费，很明显，我们最直接的办法是收取过桥费。不过，当时威尼斯政府选择在上面建起了两列店铺，靠收租金来维护大桥。而这两排店铺，被威尼斯人认为是一种有效的便利设施。它们显然比单纯收取过桥费创造了更多的价值。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  而且这些店铺的存在，成为了一种传统。以至于，在木桥被毁，重建石桥的时候，这种传统仍然得以保留。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  利亚尔多桥因此大于一个简单的交通设施，成为一个自我维持的实体。长期保持着开放的和互利的局面。类似的安排在世界上并不罕见。佛罗伦萨的Ponte
  Vecchio是另一个著名的例子。19世纪之前的伦敦桥上，不但桥面上有市场，市场楼上还有若干层公寓。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  上面两个例子足够有名，但是我还可以给你一个更加有名，而且离我们很近的例子。这就是——前门大街。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  你如果逛前门大街，你会发现它的东西两侧，在它的沿街店铺的背后，分别有一条小街。西边的称为珠宝市街和东边的被称为果子胡同。和前门大街平行。形成一个三条路平行的系统。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>说到这里，我想我无须多言。你已经懂了。（《日下旧闻考》 Zhu Yizun, 1687）</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  原始的前门大街，有60米宽。这很自然，天朝上国，大明国和大清国的皇帝去天坛祭天的道路。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  早在清朝后期，在前门大街上已经有很多临时的商业摊位，它们形成两条连续的窝棚，在晚清的老照片里你可以看到。

  在老照片里，你也可以看到庚子国变平息之后，光绪帝和慈禧太后的仪仗从窝棚之间的通道回到紫禁城。虽然被窝棚占据，但是，中间的通路，仍然有30米宽，走人走车都是戳戳有余，后来甚至在上面通了有轨电车。经年累月，两列窝棚之间的道路，成了前门大街的主街。这些窝棚，逐渐反客为主，变成正式的店铺，入住了很多豪华的主力店；而原来大街的边缘，被窝棚搁在背后的部分反而成为小巷，以亲民的小店铺为主。

  在一条经过设计的通道上，增加了摊位，术语叫做——临时性的占据、非正式的占据——这些占据，和城市经过一些时间的磨合，形成一种新的传统，改变了原有街道的配置，完成了演化。这其中，暗含的是这种参与者的博弈和利益平衡；还有权威的宽容，我们看大清国的皇帝他老人家，对于拆除违建，远远没有那么执着。

  而且，城市的自发演化的结构，是无分东方西方，无分中外的。它们运行的最基层动力是人性，人的欲望和行为模式。
