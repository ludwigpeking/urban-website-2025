  In the last chapter, the focus was on sacred sites, which represent the
  hardware necessary for the formation of a great community. These sites may
  take on various forms, such as burial ground, temples, churches, shrines,
  monuments, memorials, Confucian temples, museums, and other similar
  structures.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Sacred sites are the most fundamental components of a city. When attempting to
  identify a city, the first element to recognize is the sacred site, as the
  main narratives of a city often occur within its confines.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  A sacred site serves as the ideological center of its great community, and it
  is set apart from the of daily life. The priesthood, such as the legendary
  Japanese queen Himiko recorded in historical texts, remains a mysterious
  presence, invisible even to samurai and nobles.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The typical configuration of a sacred site comprises a temple surrounded by a
  wall, with guarded entrances. This configuration creates a miniature fortress.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Sacred sites also serve as targets of attack by other great communities, and
  thus are impregnable. Many renowned sacred sites, such as the Acropolis of
  Athens and the Capitoline Hill in Rome, which are often used as examples,
  themselves are fortified citadels situated on a small hill overlooking the
  city. Sacred sites also serve as targets of attack by other great communities,
  and thus are impregnable. Many renowned sacred sites, such as the Acropolis of
  Athens and the Capitoline Hill in Rome, which are often used as examples, are
  similar to fortified citadels situated on a small hill overlooking the city.
  These defensible locations within the city, are often occupied by citadels of
  sacred sites.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  While driving in central Italy, one may encounter numerous settlements atop
  hills, with some centered around monasteries, which are the castles
  themselves.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Cities that revolve around a castle centered on a temple are generally ancient
  republic city-states, provided they are not ruled by religious personnel. In
  contrast, in cities ruled by a monarchy, the central citadel usually belongs
  to the monarchy, but the temple is in the outer line of defense. For example,
  within the context of the Japanese feudal period, the temples and shrines of
  Oda Nobunaga's Azuchi Castle and Kato Kiyomasa's Kumamoto Castle occupied a
  secondary defense position outside the central castle, reflecting their status
  as service institutions.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  A sacred site with a sound defense capability can accommodate a variety of
  organizational roles, one of which is a treasury. Followers contribute money
  and goods, leading to the accumulation of wealth in the temple.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In general, the temple and treasury are integrated. For instance, the national
  treasury of the Roman Republic was located in the Jupiter temple on the
  Capitoline Hill. Temples in Athens, Delphi, and Ephesus also served as the
  city's treasuries.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  These treasuries led to the emergence of temples as the origin of banking. Why
  did temples engage in banking?
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Because they possess all the conditions required for operating a bank: a large
  stock, warehousing and storage capabilities, good credit and authority, and
  the ability to enforce borrowing and repayment within the community.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lending has a helpful and remedial function, as well as profitability.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Therefore, it is generally believed that temples began to exercise banking
  functions even before the advent of gold and silver currency, lending out
  items such as grain and seeds.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In Athens, Delphi, Ephesus, and Rome, their temples were important banks that
  also inspected the quality of gold and silver and minted coins.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The role of banks, treasuries, and mints is an extension of the function of
  temples and sacred sites beyond religion and ideology into the economic field.
  According to Herodotus, ancient temples even engaged in the sex industry
  before various taboos arose, though we will refrain from delving into this
  topic.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Following the decline of classical civilizations, the second "early spring" of
  Western civilization emerged during the European Middle Ages. Amidst the ruins
  of cities and villages devastated by previous conflicts, commercial cities
  began to re-emerge. The process coincided with the flourishing of pilgrimage
  activities, as observed from the phenomenon
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Although the Christian world, with its shared beliefs in Jesus Christ and the
  Virgin Mary, could be considered a single community, referring to it as a vast
  community called Christendom would be overly broad. Such a broad scope would
  be close to saying that all humans belong to a single community, which lacks
  the granularity necessary for distinguishing self and others within a
  political community from an evolutionary perspective.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In the classical world, different city-states worshiped different gods, such
  as Athena, Apollo, and Artemis, among others. These differing beliefs
  effectively distinguished separate large communities. In the Christian world,
  these ecological niches of faith could not remain vacant. Consequently,
  various regions promoted their own patron saints, who would be associated with
  relics like a thigh bone or a jawbone. Bruges venerated St. Andrew, Paris
  honored St. Denis, Toulouse worshipped St. Sernin, and Venice revered St.
  Mark, to name a few examples.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Accompanied by these relics, cities constructed grand cathedrals that elevated
  their prestige and served as a nucleus for shared identity. The architectural
  competitions for these large cathedrals reflected the ambitions of these
  city-states and fostered the growth of strong professional groups. The
  construction of a cathedral, which could take anywhere from a few decades to
  several centuries, brought together builders, artists, craftsmen, and various
  service industry personnel. As one project ended and another began, these
  professional groups moved accordingly. Notable among these groups were the
  stonemasons, The chief architect of a cathedral was typically a master
  stonemason, whose skill is too valueable to be fixed to any feud, and thus has
  a free status, whose organization evolved into the fraternal organization now
  known as Freemasonry.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  These sacred sites, particularly in Western Europe, France, and northern
  Iberia, formed a web-like pilgrimage guide map. The commercial activities
  servicing the pilgrimage routes gave rise to a new urban commercial network on
  the eve of the resurgence of Western civilization. Pilgrimages allowed people
  to leave their homelands and break away from the near-vegetative lifestyle
  described by Spengler.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Moreover, exploration is an innate human impulse. When people set sail or
  embark on unknown journeys, they are often filled with romantic emotions. It
  is this spirit that has enabled humans to spread across the world, reaching
  remote islands in the depths of the ocean like Hawaii, Easter Island, and
  Tasmania with only a canoe.

  When I visited the Basilica of St. Francis in Assisi, Italy, I saw how this
  significant religious center experienced decline. In the past, more shops
  would have been scattered along the road leading to the monastery. By
  examining the quantity and appearance of these shops, one can infer the
  strength of the urban vitality and determine whether there were important
  destinations nearby.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Real estate professionals can easily notice that a sacred site in a city is
  often regarded as an anchor store.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  What is an anchor store? In a high-end mall, Chanel may be an anchor store; it
  attracts shoppers from a wide region, and these visitors may make other
  purchases when they enter the mall. Similarly, Uniqlo, McDonald's, movie
  theaters, and art galleries can all increase foot traffic and potentially
  serve as anchor stores. Stores located near or adjacent to anchor stores
  benefit from increased foot traffic, resulting in higher rents and greater
  value.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  There are several types of structures in urban spaces that are similar to the
  structures of anchor stores.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  First, when a sacred site is at an endpoint or elevated location, the path
  leading to the sacred site, or pilgrimage route, often features commercial
  streets, markets, or temple fairs. For example, the commercial street in front
  of Asakusa Temple in Tokyo is a case of a permanent temple fair.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Below the Temple of Jupiter on Rome's Capitoline Hill is the Roman Forum,
  which itself is a market place and temple fair. Public buildings from various
  Roman eras, including temples, courts, and senate, were constructed around
  this square, with the market gradually forming roofed arcades for sheltered
  sections and larger open-air areas. The division and proportion between these
  two sections conceals a balance between comfort and efficiency and between
  rigidity and flexibility.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Second, when a sacred site is in the central area, people will establish shops
  and various buildings around it. A common form is a circular street
  surrounding a cathedral, with a square typically in front of the main entrance
  of the cathedral. For example, St. Stephen's Cathedral in Budapest is
  surrounded by a wide open space, making it easy to capture panoramic views. In
  contrast, St. Paul's Cathedral in London is nestled among a cluster of
  buildings, with streets and squares surrounding it that are narrower than
  those in Budapest.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->










<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  After the decline of classical civilization, the second early spring of
  Western civilization was in the Middle Ages in Europe. On the ruins of cities
  and villages that had been withered by wars before, commercial cities sprouted
  again. In this process, we can see it from the phenomenon and pilgrimage
  activities It has a lot to do with it.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Although the Catholic world also believes in Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary,
  you can think of them as a community, but if you say that the whole world is a
  big community called Christendom, the scope of this community is too large, it
  is It seems to say that we are all human beings. To say nothing is to say that
  we have not built a community. From an evolutionary perspective, such a system
  lacks the granularity of social evolution that distinguishes self from other
  in composing political communities necessary for competition within the
  community.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In the classical world, different city-states worshiped different gods, some
  city-states dedicated to Athena, others dedicated to Apollo, Artemis and so
  on. These differences in beliefs serve to distinguish different large
  communities.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In the Christian world, there's no way these niches are going to be vacant,
  and you're going to see their patron saints being rolled out everywhere. They
  will dig out some saint's stump, a thigh bone or a jaw from somewhere, please
  go back to your hometown and worship it. St. Andrew in Bruges, St. Denis in
  Paris, St. Satnan in Toulouse, St. Mark in Venice, and so on.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Along with the relics of these saints, a city builds its magnificent
  cathedral, which together increase the city's prestige. Form the nuclei of
  identity.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The engineering competition for the megachurch reflected the ambitions of
  these city-states and produced extremely powerful professional bodies. The
  construction process of a cathedral lasted from a short period of ten years to
  a long period of hundreds of years. The whole process formed a gathering of
  construction industry, artists, and various handicraft and service industry
  personnel. Large projects are subject to one another, and professional groups
  follow the flow of projects. Among the well-known ones are Freemasonry, which
  is called Free Mason in English, which literally means free-flowing
  stonemason. The chief designer of the cathedral is generally a master
  stonemason.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  These holy sites form a web-like pilgrimage guide map in Western Europe,
  especially in northern France and Iberia. Businesses serving pilgrimage
  activities were formed along these pilgrimage routes, constituting the urban
  commercial network on the eve of the rise of a new round of Western
  civilization.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The pilgrimage took the people out of their native lands and out of what
  Spengler called a plant-like way of life.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Moreover, exploration is an instinctive impulse of human beings. When a person
  boards a boat to sail out to sea, or packs a bag on his back to embark on an
  unknown journey, he always has romantic feelings. It is this spirit that has
  allowed human beings to spread all over the world, reaching islands deep in
  the ocean such as Hawaii, Easter Island and Tasmania only by canoe.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  I visited Peassis, Italy, where the San Franciscan Monastery is a very
  important religious center, as you can see, this is a city that has
  experienced decline, in the past, there would be more shops on the road
  leading to the monastery , you can restore the strength of the city's vitality
  in each place through the number and appearance of the shops, and judge
  whether there are important destinations nearby.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  People in the real estate industry can easily find that a holy place in a city
  is regarded as an anchor store.

  What is an anchor store? In a high-end shopping mall, Chanel may be a main
  store; Chanel will attract people who have nothing to do with it to watch.
  When these people enter the mall, they may also buy other things; similarly,
  Uniqlo, McDonald’s, movie theaters, art galleries, etc. All of them may
  increase the flow of people, and all of them may be surrounded by anchor
  stores. And the stores on the only way to the main store will benefit from
  this. The closer to the main store, next door to or opposite the store, the
  higher the rent and the more valuable because of the large number of people.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The several structures created by the Holy Land in the urban space are
  basically the structures of several anchor stores.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The first type is that the holy land is at one end, or on a high place. The
  road leading to the holy place, the pilgrimage road, or, in Japan, the sando,
  and the road outside the Japanese shrine, is called Omotesando. It often
  presents the state of commercial streets, markets, and temple fairs. Actually,
  I have already talked about the commercial street in front of Sensoji Temple.
  A case of permanent stalls in a temple fair.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Below the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill in Rome is the Roman Forum,
  the Forum, which itself is a free market and a temple fair. The public
  buildings of ancient Roman dynasties, including temples, courts, and
  parliament buildings, were built around this square, and the market gradually
  formed a covered corridor as a part that could shelter from the rain and a
  larger open-air part. . The division of these two parts also hides a balance
  of structure, comfort and efficiency; a balance of fixity and flexibility; we
  won’t discuss it too much.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The combination of the temple and the market, all the cities built by the
  Romans have such a structure; of course, this is not their invention, Athens
  also diagonally crosses a square that serves as a market, and then walks
  towards the gate of the Acropolis.

<p>
  The second type, when the holy land is in the center, people will build shops
  and various buildings around it. The common form is a circle of streets around
  the main church, or wide or houses, and the front of the main entrance is
  generally enlarged as square. As wide as Budapest, there is a wide open space
  of more than 30 meters around St. Stefan's Church. In this way, it is easier
  for you to take a panoramic view of the church; St. Paul's Church in London is
  also surrounded by street squares, the street is more than ten meters wide,
  and the main entrance is slightly wider; this is much narrower than Budapest,
  so St. Paul's Church gives the impression that it is nested in a pile Inside
  the building. It's not too compact though. In fact, it can be even more
  compact. Because the church usually has only one door for the public to enter
  and exit, and it is generally surrounded by very closed solid walls. So the
  streets around it are one-sided streets from a commercial point of view.

<p>
  On a 100-meter-long street, if each shop is 10 meters wide, the original two
  sides can accommodate 20 shops, while the street facing the church wall only
  has the other side, and the same 100-meter-long can only accommodate 10 shops.
  In this way, the services that can be provided in the same area are much less.
  Although the facade of the church can be beautifully decorated, it always
  dilutes the vitality of its adjacent street. So in my opinion this would not
  be the best structure. No need to worry, in Amsterdam, you will see that on
  the outer wall of the main church, there is a circle of small shops like
  psoriasis. These shops cover the solemn and beautiful exterior walls of the
  church, leaving only the entrance and exit space for the church. These small
  shops can be directly attached to the church, and less walls can be built,
  which is indeed very economical and efficient. If the small shop catches fire,
  it may damage the church. However, this is the earth, even if a person lives
  on the grassland, he may be burnt to his ass by wildfire.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  This kind of addition has greatly improved the commercial value, which is very
  pleasing to the eye in my opinion. However, this is not the most compact
  solution. The most compact plan is also one of the most brilliant architects
  in human history, the 16th century Venetian architect Palladio.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  This is Vicenza's cathedral Palladio Basilica, Basilica, is a Latin word,
  meaning the assembly hall. The church, it seemed, was an ornate public hall of
  continuous vaults. But its first floor is actually all shops. You have to go
  through a big staircase and go up to the second floor, which is the church.
  This is like many shopping centers today, where the cinema is placed upstairs.
  If you want to watch a movie, you will pass by various shops downstairs, which
  is convenient for you to go shopping. This is actually nothing new. The
  ancients had made similar arrangements five hundred years ago or even earlier.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  But when you try to praise Palladio's cleverness, you make a mistake. The
  essence of the scheme is not what he offered. In fact, the shops existed
  before the church was built. The proposal of the church just respects the
  existence of these shops and integrates them into the new plan. What is really
  smart is not the architect, but the value orientation of Vicenza. An important
  public building is not enough to outlaw ordinary shops. Every store is a
  money-making institution, an organization, a tradition, and a culture, on
  which the livelihood and lifestyle of the members of the community are
  attached.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  A monument, a shrine, and its compositional relationship to the city around it
  is an indicator of the degree of commercial freedom of a city and a people,
  and is likely to be related to its wealth, tradition, and creativity. It
  doesn't have to be particularly accurate, but it must not be an insignificant
  piece of evidence.
</p>

<p>
  According to Hayek: Man makes choices by action, not by reason. The collection
  of human spontaneous actions will experience the selection of the environment,
  and finally generate results, which have a more delicate structure and digital
  logic than the design of great men.

  上一期，讲的是圣地，圣地是大共同体的形成所需要的硬件。其名称可以是墓园、神殿、教堂、神社、纪念碑、纪念堂、孔庙、博物馆等等。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>圣地，是城市最核心的一个组件。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在识别一个城市的时候，首先要识别出这个组件，城市最主要的故事就是发生在这里的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  一个圣地，是它的大共同体的意识形态中心，他和日常生活经常存在反差。祭司，比如我们知道史书里日本古代的女王卑弥呼，她是不见普通人的，连武士贵族都见不到她，是一个很神秘的存在。最典型的配置，是一个神殿，外面一圈围墙。门禁是有人把守的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>这种配置，就形成了一个小堡垒。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  圣地也是其他大共同体攻击的对象。它是不能随便被敌人占领的。所以我们知道的很多著名的圣地，比如我经常做为例子的雅典卫城、罗马的卡比多山，它们和堡垒没有区别，都在一个可以俯瞰城市的狭小山顶上。占据一个城中城堡的位置，英文叫Citadel。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  如果你在意大利中部开车，你路上会看到很多在山顶上的聚落，其中一部分是修道院为核心的村庄，而修道院就是城堡本身。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  你看，凡是以神庙为中心城堡的城市，如果它不是一个宗教人士统治的城市，那么它一般会是古代共和制城邦。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  而在王权统治的城市，一般中心城堡是王权的领域，而寺院，一般是中心城堡外面，第二层防御中的内容。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  织田信长修建的安土城、加藤清正的熊本城里寺庙和神社处在半山坡，山下比较容易到达的位置。体现出它们做为服务机构的性质。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>一个具有健全的防御能力圣地，能适合更多的组织角色；</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>其中之一是金库。信徒进献钱财物品，这样神庙就会有很多的财产存货。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  一般，神殿和金库是一体的。罗马共和国的国库，就在卡比多山上的朱庇特神庙里。雅典、德尔斐、以弗所的神殿也一样，也都同时是城市的金库。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>这些金库，导致神庙是银行的起源。神庙为什么要搞银行业？</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  因为神庙具有经营银行业的所有条件：它有大量的存货、有仓库和保管能力、良好的信用和权威性、有在共同体内追缴借贷的能力。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>主观上，借贷是有帮助和救济功能的，而且还有盈利。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  所以一般认为在神庙出现之初，在金银货币出现之前，神庙就开始行使银行功能，只不过借出的粮食、种子之类的物品。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在雅典、德尔菲、以弗所和罗马，他们的神庙都是重要的银行。并且他们还负责鉴定金银成色，把金银铸造成货币。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  银行、金库、铸币机构的角色，是神庙，圣地的机能，拓展到宗教和意识形态之外的经济领域一个方面。根据希罗多德，古代的神庙，在各种禁忌开始兴起之前，甚至经营色情业，for
  some reasons，我们不做特别多的分析。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在古典文明衰落之后，西方文明的第二个早春，是在欧洲的中世纪，之前战乱中凋敝的城市和乡村的废墟上，商业城市重新萌发了出来，这个过程，我们从现象上看，和朝圣活动的繁荣存在一些同时性。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  虽然，同样是天主教世界，同样信仰耶稣基督和圣母玛利亚，你可以认为他们是一个共同体，但是，如果你说全世界就是一个大大大共同体，叫做Christendom，这种共同体范围就过大，就好像说我们都是人类一样，废话一句，等于没有构建共同体。
  从演化的角度，这样的系统缺乏在这个共同体之内进行竞争所必需的组合成政治共同体的，社会演化中区别自我和他者的颗粒度。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在古典世界，不同城邦供奉不同的神祗，一些城邦供奉雅典娜，另一些供奉阿波罗、阿尔忒弥斯等等。这些信仰差异很好的区分了不同的大共同体。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在基督教世界，这些信仰的生态位也不可能空缺，你会看到，各地都会推出他们的守护圣人。他们会从什么地方挖出一些圣人的殘肢，一条大腿骨或者一个下巴，请回老家，供奉起来。布鲁日供奉圣安德鲁，巴黎供奉圣丹尼，图卢兹供奉圣萨特南，威尼斯供奉圣马可，等等。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  配合着这些圣人的遗骨，一个城市会建起它的宏伟的大教堂，它们一起提升城市的声望。构成认同的凝结核。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  大型教堂的工程竞赛，体现了这些城邦的雄心，也培育出极其强大的专业团体。一个大教堂的建设过程，短的十几年，长的几百年，整个过程形成了建筑业者、艺术家和各种手工业和服务业人员的聚集。大工程此即彼服，专业团体也就随着工程流动。其中很著名的包括共济会，英文叫Free
  Mason，它的字面意思是自由流动的石匠。大教堂的总设计师，一般就是大师级的石匠。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这些圣地，在西欧，特别是在法国和伊比利亚北部，形成一个网状的朝圣导游图。服务朝圣活动的商业，在这些朝圣之路之间形成，构成了新一轮西方文明兴起前夜的城市商业网络。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>朝圣活动，让人民离开他们的乡土，脱离斯宾格勒说的近于植物的生活方式。</p>

  而且，探索，是人的一种本能的冲动。当人登上船要扬帆出海，或者背上包走上未知的旅程的时候，总是怀着浪漫的感情。是这种精神，让人类遍及世界，仅仅凭借独木舟就到达了夏威夷、复活节岛和塔斯马尼亚这种大洋深处的岛屿。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  我参观意大利佩阿西西，这里的圣方济修道院是一个非常重要的宗教中心，你可以看到，这是座经历了衰退的城市，从前，会有更多的店铺分布在通向修道院的路上，你可以通过店铺的多少和外观来还原每一处曾经具有的城市活力的强弱，并且判断出这附近是否有重要的目的地。
</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>房地产行业的人，很容易发现，一个城市里圣地，就视同一个主力店。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  什么是主力店？在一个高档商场里，香奈儿可能是一个主力店；香奈儿，会吸引原本不相干的人去观看，这些人进入商场，就有可能还买其他东西；类似的，优衣库、麦当劳、电影院、美术馆，都有可能增加人流，都有可能有主力店的左右。而在通向主力店的必经之路上的商店都会因此而受益，离主力店越近、在它的隔壁、或者对面的商店，总是因为人流多，从而租金更高，更加具有价值。<p>圣地在城市空间中导致的几种结构，基本就是几种主力店的结构。</p>
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  第一种，圣地在一个尽头，或者在高处。通往圣地的道路，朝圣之路，或者，日本叫参道、日本神社外面的道路，叫表参道。经常呈现商业街、市场、庙会的状态。其实，我之前已经讲过浅草寺前的商业街。一种庙会的摊位永久化的案例。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  罗马的卡比多山的朱庇特神庙的下面，就是罗马的广场，广场forum，他的本身就是自由市场，是庙会。古罗马历朝历代的公共建筑、包括神庙、法庭、元老院，都是围绕这个广场建设，而市场也逐渐形成有屋顶的回廊，做为可以避雨的部分和更大的开阔的露天的部分。这两部分的分割也隐藏着一种结构，舒适和效率的平衡；固定与灵活的平衡；我们不过多讨论。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  神殿与市场的结合，罗马人修建的所有城市，都具有这样的结构；这当然也不是他们的发明，雅典，也是斜穿过一个做为市场的广场，再走向卫城的山门。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  第二种，当圣地在中心地带的时候，人们会围着它建立店铺和各种建筑，常见的形式，是围绕着主教堂，或宽或窄的一圈街道，其中正门前一般放大为广场。宽的比如布达佩斯，圣施特凡教堂周围有三十多米的宽阔的空地。这样你就比较容易拍摄教堂的全景；伦敦的圣保罗教堂周围也是街道广场，街道有十几米宽，主入口稍微宽阔；这比布达佩斯窄得多，所以圣保罗教堂，给人的印象是窝在一堆建筑里面。不过这还不是太紧凑。其实，还可以更紧凑。因为教堂，通常只有一个公众进出的大门，一般它四周是非常封闭的实墙。所以它周围的街道，从商业角度上是单边街道。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>什么是单边街道？</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这就是维琴察的大教堂帕拉迪奥巴西里卡，巴西里卡，是拉丁词，意思是聚会用的大会堂。这座教堂，它看上去，是一座连续拱圈的华丽的公共大厅。但是它的一楼其实全都是店铺。你要通过一个大楼梯，上到二楼，才是教堂。这就像今天很多的很多购物中心，把电影院放在楼上，你要去看电影，会路过楼下的各种商店，方便你去购物。这其实没什么新鲜的，五百年前甚至更早之前，古人就做过类似的安排。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在100米长的街道上，每个店铺假如10米宽，原本两面一共可以容下20个店铺，而面对教堂墙壁的街道，只剩下另外一边，同样100米长就只能容下10间，这样同样区域内可以提供的服务就少的多。虽然教堂的墙面可以装饰得漂亮，但是对于它相邻的街道的活力总是有所稀释。所以在我看来，这不会是一个最好的结构。无需费心，在阿姆斯特丹，你会看到，主教堂的外墙上，像牛皮癣一样贴着盖了一圈小店铺。这些店铺遮挡了教堂庄严美好的外墙，只给教堂留下了出入口的空间。这些小店可以直接贴着教堂，就可以少建面墙，确实非常节省，非常高效。如果小店着火，有可能殃及教堂。然而这就是地球，即便一个人住在草原上，也有可能被野火燎到屁股。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这样的增建大大提高了商业价值，在我看来分外顺眼。然而这还不是最紧凑的方案。最紧凑的方案，也是出自人类历史上最高明的建筑师之一，16世纪威尼斯建筑师帕拉迪奥。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  但是，当你想称赞帕拉迪奥的聪明时，你会翻一个错误，这个方案的精髓不是他提供的。事实上，在教堂修建之前，这些店铺就已经存在了。而教堂的方案，只不过是尊重了这些店铺的存在，把他们整合到了新的方案之中。真正聪明的不是建筑师，而是维琴察的价值取向。一个重要的公共建筑物，不足以取缔普通的商店。每一个商店，他是一个赚钱的机构，也是一个组织，一个传统，一种文化，其上是附着着共同体成员的生计和生活方式的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  一个纪念碑，一个圣地，它和它周围的城市之间的组合关系，是一个城市一个民族商业自由程度的指示器，也很可能与其财富、传统和创造性有关。它不一定特别准，但是一定不是一个无关紧要的证据。

  根据哈耶克的说法：人是用行动，而不是理性来做出选择的。而人的自发行动的集合，会经历环境的选择，最后生成结果，比伟人的设计具有更加精巧的结构和数字逻辑。

<p>这就是本期的陈腐粉碎机。</p>
