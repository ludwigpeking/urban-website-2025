  Some surveys (such as Gallup Global Emotions Report ) stating that peoples may
  have more positive view toward their lives, even without higher income or
  longer life expectancy.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  This observation may contradict the conventional wisdom of our society, which
  largely values the pursuit of development and success. However, it's not
  particularly surprising when one considers that some African societies are
  culturally closer to hunter-gatherer traditions than societies in Europe,
  North America, or East Asia.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In these societies, people gather tropical fruits from trees and hunt various
  animals. The men and women are strong and beautiful, full of the joy of
  physical activity. Their daily labor lasts no more than four hours, leaving
  ample time for singing and dancing. Life is lived without long-term plans,
  often planned no more than three days in advance. While illness and hunger are
  occasional problems, death, when it comes, is swift and suffering is
  short-lived.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Max Weber once stated that workers from these hunter-gatherer societies would
  not work longer hours if their wages were increased. Rather, they would work
  fewer hours because they only intend to earn a certain amount of money. If
  their wages are doubled, they will work half as much and spend more time in
  leisure.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Considering that 95% of the 2.5 million years of human history were spent in
  this way, it could be argued that human nature and our innate qualities were
  primarily shaped by this lifestyle. The ability to endure, plan for the long
  term, and nurture grand ambitions are comparatively recent cultural
  developments.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  We, the people of agricultural and industrial societies, measure
  hunter-gatherers by our standards, much like what Wang Guowei suggested: "we
  gauge the lives of these simpler folk using our own desires for status. We are
  often unaware that their desires for a fulfilling life have been better
  satisfied than ours. " Indeed, archaeological evidence suggests that the
  transition from the relatively healthy, happy, and leisurely lifestyle of
  hunting and gathering to engaging in agriculture was a forced act.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The earliest evidence of humans collecting plant seeds to make flour-like food
  dates back to approximately 300,000 years ago, predating the appearance of
  Homo sapiens. However, a significant shift occurred about 12,000 years ago, a
  period known as the "Younger Dryas event," which was a mini ice age making the
  climate dry and cold. To secure a more stable food source, the ancient people
  in the Middle East, particularly in the Euphrates River Valley, had to depend
  on cultivated crops and their seeds for survival, thus marking the dawn of the
  Agricultural Age.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Yuval Noah Harari, in his book "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind," argued
  that humans took up agriculture to feed the tens of thousands of workers
  constructing the Tower of Babel.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Regardless of which view one accepts, the fact remains that humans adopting
  agriculture is a relatively recent phenomenon. Before this, only the dead were
  settled. But now, to care for their crops, people had to become settled. As
  crops could only be harvested every few months, grain had to be stored in
  containers and granaries. This development led to settled villages, marked by
  grain silos, which combined with holy places, temples, or markets, eventually
  became larger human settlements, almost cities.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The oldest cities appeared in the Levant, which is the western part of the
  Fertile Crescent, including modern-day Israel, Jordan, and Syria. One city,
  whose name is well known to us, is Jericho, which has a history of 11,500
  years.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The discovery of a 10,000-year-old stone tower in Jericho has led some
  archaeologists, like Barkai from Tel Aviv University, to argue that the
  structure was likely designed to intimidate the local populace. It served as a
  constant reminder of their insignificance and encouraged respect and
  submission to the burdensome and tiresome lifestyle imposed by agricultural
  communes, along with the pressures of the social hierarchies in these new
  societies.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Agriculture was indeed a distinct profession that dramatically altered human
  lifestyles. Humans, originally highly mobile creatures, became stationary with
  the onset of agriculture. They started to care for crops, developed an
  affinity for the land, and their lives became more monotonous, almost
  plant-like according to Spengler's perspective.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Who has the power?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The advantage of being a farmer lies in their consistent and abundant food
  income. They owned houses and granaries, allowing them to store food and
  possess many private properties. They were able to sustain a consistent diet
  and enjoy a more predictable lifestyle in the short term. Hunter-gatherers, in
  contrast, led a nomadic life, eating irregularly, and all their possessions
  were only what they could carry.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Furthermore, agriculture supports a much higher population density. As
  previously discussed, a square kilometer of grassland could not support even
  one hunter, but the same area of farmland can sustain hundreds of farmers.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In modern conversations about net assets, profit margins, growth rates, etc.,
  farmers seem more successful than hunters, more akin to the "winners" of life.
  If life were a stock market, the farmers' stocks would be blue-chip, while
  hunters' would be considered junk stocks.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  However, this perspective is not necessarily accurate. Hunters, from a young
  age, were trained in archery and could kill almost instinctively. While
  farmers could be healthy and strong, they could hardly match the combat
  prowess of hunters. When farmers encountered hunters, they found themselves
  unable to protect their possessions or their lives. This cycle has been
  repeated throughout history.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The term 'hunter' I use here is a broad one. They could be hunter-gatherer
  tribes, nomadic tribes, or any culture influenced by these lifestyles. For
  example, hunting game was a favorite pastime of English kings and Manchu
  emperors. These activities were not mere entertainment but serious training
  and even selection processes for successors and military commanders. This can
  be considered a cultural legacy passed down from their barbarian ancestors,
  making them broadly defined 'hunters'.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Though the hunter populations were often small, they were, in many ways, the
  protagonists of history. In the late Roman Empire, the Roman legions were
  powerless against the invading Germanic tribes. The empire relied on Franks,
  early Germanic immigrants, to defend it as they were more martial than the
  agricultural Latin people. The Byzantine Empire relied on Varangian warriors,
  or Vikings, to fend off attacks from various Turkic, Avar, and Bulgarian
  nomadic tribes.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The Sui and Tang Dynasties, according to their official accounts, originated
  from Wuchuan, north of Yinshan in Inner Mongolia, which was not an
  agricultural area. The Li family, founders of the Tang dynasty, were skilled
  horsemen and warriors. However, by their fifth generation, Emperor Tang Ming
  Huang, the martial spirit of the family had faded, and they became more
  artistic. The military responsibility is mostly on generals and regional
  commanders who were non-Han people, and when facing internal challenges
  provoked by these 'barbarian generals', the court recruited other barbarian
  generals from the western frontier to quell the unrest.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  At the turn of the Ming and Qing dynasties, it was no different. Dorgon's
  Manchu Banner Men, traditionally hunters, were only forty to fifty thousand
  strong, crushed the Ming empire with a peasant population over a hundred
  millions.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Farmers were extremely vulnerable when faced with the formidable hunters. The
  hunters had the potential to slaughter the farmers. This situation, much like
  the Mongol conquests of the middle asia, indeed had occurred.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  But the slaughter of farmers was not necessarily the most advantageous for
  hunters. Replacing farmers and occupying their land offered little gain to the
  hunters' way of life. However, if the hunters left the farmers alone and
  collected protection fees from them, a stable source of long-term income would
  form. From the farmers' perspective, paying the hunters protection fees in
  exchange for their protection, and being spared from the slaughter by other
  hunter tribes, was a viable option.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Protectors and Proctectees</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  This brings us to the main point of this section. A symbiotic relationship
  often forms between hunters and farmers. A relationship between protectors and
  those being protected. The relationship between sellers and buyers of martial
  power. They are the two sides of a typical symbiosis in city states.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Once hunters enter this symbiotic mode, they transform into warriors and
  nobles, the higher ranks of urban society.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Different situations lead to different interactions between hunters and
  farmers, between sellers and buyers of martial power.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol>
  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    Hired Warriors: Sometimes, the hunters find themselves in the position of
    guest armies, unable to suppress the farmers. At these times they are like
    mercenary guards, similar to the Varangian Guards. Moreover, this
    interactive relationship can be reversed. This is exemplified by the
    Mamluks, who started as guards and ended up rulers of Egypt; or by Francesco
    Sforza, a mercenary captain who became the Duke of Milan.
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    Allied: the Crusaders was initially an ally of the Byzantines. But became
    invited conquerors.
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    Invasive: in most of the other cases., when hunters have the upper hand in
    this symbiotic relationship, they are military colonists, and the farmers
    are the conquered;
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  When they form a relatively harmonious and stable community with the farmers,
  they are seen as the relationship between the warrior nobility and civilian
  tenants.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>High Tension</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The symbiotic relationship between hunters and farmers inherently carries
  strong tensions.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The Spartans of ancient Greece were believed to be very inhumane towards their
  slaves, who were called Helots.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Helots' daily task was to farm for the Spartans. But their situation seemed
  even worse than that of ordinary slaves. According to Herodotus, the
  population of the Helots was seven times that of the Spartans. One can imagine
  that if they were organized, even if they were just using farming tools, they
  would pose a significant threat to the Spartans.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Each year, the Spartans would conduct a purge, killing any influential or
  brave Helots who might become leaders. They had to ensure that the Helot
  community remained leaderless and scattered, absolutely devoid of any
  organization.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Generally speaking, systematic violence within a society would lead to its
  moral collapse.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Therefore, this phenomenon cannot be understood with the logic of internal
  relations within the community. Prior to classical Greek times, in 12th
  century BC the Dorians invaded the Peloponnese from the north. The Spartans
  were a branch of them. In other words, the Spartans were foreign hunters,
  military conquerors. The Helots, on the other hand, were native Greeks. They
  came from different communities. Furthermore, the Spartans did not work on
  integrating themselves into the local society, and did not let the Helots
  engage in service industries that required close cooperation with the rulers.
  They were treated purely as an economic resource.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  This highly tense form of symbiosis is indeed special, but not necessarily
  unique. The rulers of the Yin Shang dynasty liked to use living human
  sacrifices. Thousands of human sacrificial bones were unearthed from the Yin
  Ruins. The Shang people conducted hunting activities, and their hunting
  targets included alien humans who lived outside their colonies. These
  activities could not only be a kind of sacrificial activity or pure hunting
  entertainment. The nature of population control and economic exploitation of
  the conquered people could be seen, which seemed to echo the relationship
  between the Spartans and the Helots.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The Varna caste system of ancient India consists of three primary castes. The
  first, Brahmin, are the priests and ideological administrators. The second,
  Kshatriya, are warriors and nobles. According to the Aryan theory, these two
  castes are descendants of the Eurasian steppe-originated invaders, who had a
  custom of worshipping cows, hence broadly descendants of hunters. The
  so-called Aryan descendants may not be bloodline descendants, but they are, at
  the very least, political and professional successors. They conquered the
  Indus River Valley and placed the native agricultural population under their
  rule.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The third caste, Vaishya, is made up of agricultural, commercial, and
  artisanal citizens. Their origin is either at the periphery of hunter groups,
  joining the hunter community earlier than the natives, or they are the
  mixed-race offspring of hunters and locals. In any case, they are the united
  front targets of the conquerors.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The fourth caste, Shudra, are the descendants of the conquered native
  agricultural population of the Indus Valley. They lack citizenship and do not
  undergo rites of passage.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  These castes display a clear symbiotic relationship between hunters and
  farmers. However, the potential for unification and integration between
  hunters and farmers is also evident. In many modern societies, after several
  generations or dozens of generations of vertical integration, the descendants
  of hunters and farmers have mostly integrated. But this kind of integrated
  society of warriors and civilians, appearing homogenous and static, is
  actually a temporary state in history; the existence of foreign order, the
  hierarchical differences between warriors and civilians, the symbiosis within
  opposition, and the dynamic evolution between each other, are more typical
  over larger timescales.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In cities worldwide, traces of this class-based symbiotic opposition are
  remarkably apparent. The most common form is the castle.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Castles, often regarded as possessing romantic qualities, are associated with
  noble morals and lifestyle. Yet, did you know that in most cultures, the
  ancestors of the nobility were barbarians, or hunters? The symbiosis of
  hunters and farmers, as rulers or protectors of the farmers, led to their
  settlement among the farmers.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Despite their superior military ability, hunters were few in number, perhaps
  only one-tenth or one-hundredth of the farmers. Hence, they had to first
  protect themselves from potential retaliation from their protectees, the local
  farmers.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>The Protagonist</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In England, there are numerous castles, many of which were built during the
  Norman Conquest. The Normans fought their way through but, to effectively rule
  a large country with their mere tens of thousands of knights, they built
  castles wherever they conquered. Between 1066 and 1087, the Norman conquerors
  built 36 castles in central England.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The Manchu Qing dynasty entered the pass with tens of thousands of Eight
  Banners soldiers to rule hundreds of millions of Ming people. The Eight
  Banners troops were not spread out like pepper powder. Within the great wall,
  there were seven garrisons in Jiangning, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, Jingzhou, Xi'an,
  Chengdu, and Guangzhou, each with several thousand soldiers. Apart from these
  seven, there were more than a dozen other locations with Eight Banners
  garrisons. They generally had an independent enclave, called Manchu City,
  Tartarian City or Banner City.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Manchu City, the fortress of the hunters. In the context of the continuous
  settlements of farmers, it forms several isolated islands. Similar to the
  warrior nobility of many cultures throughout history, they form a fortified
  area in or near civilian cities. These Manchu Cities were the primary bases of
  Qing rule. Moreover, during times of war or revolution, such as the Taiping
  Rebellion and the Xinhai Revolution, these Manchu Cities were crucial. For
  example, the Manchu Eight Banners in Nanjing resisted the Taiping Rebellion in
  a scorched-earth defense, sacrificing themselves for the honor of their race .
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The symbiosis of hunters and farmers can almost be directly equated with
  "colonialism," seemingly full of contradictions and tension. However, this
  symbiotic relationship exhibits great vitality. Moreover, it is not only the
  main form of the initial origins of cities but also the precursor of many of
  today's world cities. The Tower of London, for instance, is the fortress from
  which the Normans ruled the native English. The Jin Dynastry Peking, or
  Khanbaliq, is clearly the outpost set up by the nomadic tribes in the
  agricultural areas at the foot of the mountains.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  That is to say, this kind of symbiotic relationship has become the protagonist
  of the evolutionary system. This precisely indicates that this symbiotic
  relationship possesses elements of order and organization, efficiency
  advantages, and the ability for sustainable development.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  As this series unfolds, I hope to further elaborate on these relationships.
</p>

<p>
  我看过一些调研说，非洲一些人民非常贫困，寿命不长，但是对生活非常满意。乃至于，很多非洲国家的生活满意度在全球名列前茅。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>这种说法，可能会违背我们生活的这个热爱发展和成功的社会的常识。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  但是，其实也没有奇怪的——非洲很多社会的文化，比欧美或者东亚的社会更加的接近狩猎采集文化的遗风。人们采撷树上的热带果实，狩猎各种野兽。男人女人强健俊美，充满运动的乐趣，每日劳作不过四个小时，有大把唱歌跳舞的娛樂時間。他们的生活沒有計劃，有计划也不超过三天，不做什么长远打算。有時会有疾病和饥饿的困擾，但是死亡是急促的、痛苦也是短暂的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  按照是馬克思韋伯的说法：这些带有狩猎采集社会风俗工人，你给他涨工资，5块涨到10块，不会让他工作更长的时间，只会让他工作的时间更少，因为他一共就只打算挣那10块钱，原来需要干两小时，现在干一个小时就行了。你给他涨工资，他肯定选择少干一会，多玩一会。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  人屬動物的歷史，有250萬年。在这其中95%的时间之中，人们的生活方式就是如此。或者说，人类的天性、先天的禀赋主要是为这种生活方式准备的。而悬梁刺股的忍耐力、长远计划的能力和宏大的事業心，反而是一种非常晚近的、变异的文化现象。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  而我们农业社会、工业社会的人，用自己的想法去衡量狩猎采集人民。按照王国维先生的说法：这就是用我们的势利之欲来揣度簡單的生活的人；完全不知道，人家的生活之欲早就比他们更好地得到了满足。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  确实，有考古证据认为，人类放弃相对健康、快樂而且清闲的狩猎采集生活，而从事农业，是一个被迫的行为。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  人属动物最早收集植物种子制作类似面粉的食物，根据某些考古证据，是非常古老的，可以上述到30萬年前，在智人出现之前。但是，大概在12000年前，发生了卓老板曾经介绍过的“新仙女木事件”，也就是一个小冰期，气候变得干燥寒冷；中东地区、幼发拉底河流域的古人，为了获得更稳定的食物来源，不得不依靠照顾农作物，吃它们的种子为生。从而最早进入了农业时代。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  《人类简史》里面赫拉利认为，人类从事农业，是为了给几万名建造巴别塔的工人提供食物。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>不管采信哪一种，那不是咱们的重点。总之，人从事农业是相当晚近的事情。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在此之前，只有死人是定居的。但是現在，爲了照顧自己種下的莊稼，人民不得不定居下來。而糧食，需要几个月才收穫一次，之间有很长的间隔，需要把粮食儲存起來。農人于是开发出储存器皿（陶罐）和粮仓。以谷仓为标识，形成了定居的村莊，如果和上一期講過的聖地、廟會或者市场組合起來。就會出现比较大的人类定居点，这就几乎是城市了。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  最古老的城市，出现在黎凡特地区，也就是新月沃地的西部，以色列、约旦、叙利亚一带，其中有一个城市，地名我们非常熟悉，叫——杰里科。它有11500年的历史。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  杰里科出土有一座10000年历史的石头塔楼，根据特拉维夫大学考古学家Barkai认为，这座楼是）用于震慑这个居民点的人民，让他们認爲自己是非常渺小的存在，讓他們能够敬畏和尊重农业公社的压抑、劳累的生活方式和這種新型社会中的社會阶层压力。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  农民，确实是一种和猎人截然不同的职业。人类原本是一种具有很强流动性的动物，但是在从事农业之后，他们开始照顾农作物、开始对土地产生眷恋并且依附于土地，他们的生活更加单调，并且按照斯宾格勒的说法是，重新具有了植物性。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  農人的优势就是，他们有稳定和充足的粮食收入，他们有房屋和谷仓，因此可以储藏食物，拥有很多私有财产，一天吃三顿四顿都可以，短期看日子总是过得下去。而猎人是流动生活的，饥一顿饱一顿，他们没有坛坛罐罐，全部家当就是双手能拿的了的东西。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>同时，农业能够支持的人口密度也高得多。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  我之前讲过土地承载力的概念；1平方公里的草原连一个猎人都养不活；但是如果是一平方公里农田，可以养活上百个农民。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  按照今天我们在饭桌上聊天的思路，按照净资产、利润率、增长率等等来评价，农人比猎人优质的多，接近人生贏家得多。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>如果买股票，似乎，农人的股票是绩优股，而猎人的股票是没法买的垃圾股。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>然而，其实不一定是这样。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  獵人是從會走路開始，就學習射箭，可以以近於本能的方式殺戮。&nbsp;农人虽然也可以健康强壮，但是战斗力是无法和猎人相比的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  当农人碰到猎人的时候，你会发现单纯的农人，在猎人面前，既无法保证自己的财产，也无法保证自己生命。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  猎人为刀俎，农人为鱼肉。歷史上反覆出現。所谓猎人，可以是一种笼统的称呼；它们可以是狩猎采集部落，也可以是游牧部落，或者受他们文化和生活方式影响的民族或者他们的后裔，你看英国历代国王的娱乐，是带着自己的贵族哥们儿们，用双桶猎枪涉猎大雁或者麋鹿。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  满族皇帝定期组织打猎，叫木兰秋狝。意思就是打鹿。但是这个活动进行非常郑重，带有很强的比武和训练性质，甚至有选择皇位继承人和筛选军事统帅的作用，很难认为是单纯娱乐了。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  英王和清国的大皇帝，他们的风俗中都透露出他们继承自蛮族祖先的文化遗产，你可以认为他们是猎人的继承人，广义的猎人。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>猎人的人口经常是不多的，但是他们其实更像是历史的主角。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  罗马帝国的晚期，当日耳曼蛮族侵入帝国边界时；帝国的军团无力抵抗，只能靠招安略早归化罗马的日耳曼人移民，也就是法兰克人来保卫帝国。他们比从事农业上千年的拉丁人要武勇得多。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  而拜占庭帝国，依靠瓦良格武士，也就是维京人，来对抗各路突厥人、阿瓦尔人、保加尔人游牧部族的进攻。

<p>
  隋唐帝国，按其官方说法都起源自武川，武川在内蒙古阴山以北，显然不是农业地区。而在搬家到长安，生下唐高宗之前，李式的父子兄弟都是弓马娴熟、英勇善战。

  但是到了第五代，也就是唐明皇的时候，家族的彪悍已经褪掉，变成了文艺工作者。李唐的军人和节度使，比如安禄山本人及其部下，大多是胡人；当安禄山造反，而当李唐王朝需要抵抗的时候，也是在陇西河套一带，把另一些胡人为主的武士招募起来，来平定安史之乱。

  明清之际，也一样。多尔衮的八旗健兒，也就是他们的猎手，才不過四五萬人。而大明国有上億的農業人口。

<p>
  农人面对强悍的猎人的时候，是非常脆弱的。猎人，有可能对农人进行杀戮。这种情况，如同我们听说过的蒙古西征时，确实也曾经发生过。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  但是屠杀农人，并不一定是对猎人最有利的；猎人取代农人，占据其土地，对于猎人的生活方式来说，所获不多。但是，如果留下农人，向农人收取保护费，则会形成长期稳定的收入来源。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  从农人的角度，向猎人缴纳保护费，也以换取猎人保护他们，免受其他猎人部落的杀戮。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这样，我们终于进入了本节的正题。猎人和农人之间往往形成共生关系。保护人和被保护人的关系。&nbsp;出售武力和购买武力的卖方和买方的关系。他们是城市中常有的共生的两方。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>猎人进入这种共生模式之后，就转变成为武士贵族，他们是城市人的主干。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>不同的情况下，猎人和农人，卖方和买方，的互动不同。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  猎人，在这种共生关系中，占据优势的时候，猎人就是军事殖民者，而农人则是被征服者；
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  当他们和农人之间形成比较和谐稳定的共同体，他们就被认为是武士贵族和平民佃户的关系；也有时候，猎人们处于客军的地位，没能压制住农人。这时他们就是雇佣兵卫队。像瓦良格武士一样。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  而且，这种互动关系也可以逆转。这就是马穆鲁克做为卫队，统治埃及；或者，雇佣兵队长斯富尔扎成为米兰公爵。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>猎人和农人的共生关系，天然地带有很强的张力。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  古希腊的斯巴达人，据认为对他们的奴隶，是非常不人道的；斯巴达人的奴隶，被称为Helots，希洛人、也翻译成黑劳士。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  他们每天干的事情就是给斯巴达人种地。但是他们比一般奴隶似乎生活的处境更差，根据希罗多德，黑劳士的人口是斯巴达人的7倍。可以想象，如果他们被组织起来，那么即便只是使用农具，也够斯巴达人喝一壶的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  斯巴达人每年都会去进行扫黑除恶，有威望的或者武勇的黑劳士个体，有可能成为领袖的，都需要杀掉。要确保黑劳士社群处于一种群龙无首、一盘散沙的状态，务必使其毫无组织。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>一般来说， 在社会内部，这样系统性的使用暴力，会导致它的的道德瓦解。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  所以，这个现象，不能用共同体内部的逻辑来理解。希腊古代时代之前，有一个从北方入侵博罗奔尼撒半岛的蛮族，多利亚人，斯巴达人是它的一个分支；换句话说，斯巴达人，是外来的猎人，军事征服者。而黑劳士，是希腊本地的原生居民。它们来自不同的共同体。而且斯巴达人对人口众多的黑劳士没有使用统战策略，没有把他们整合到自己的社会当中，没有让黑劳士从事服务业之类需要和统治者亲密配合的工作。而是把他们做为纯粹的经济资源。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>这种高紧张度的共生方式，确实比较特别。但是不一定是唯一的。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  殷商的统治者，特别喜欢用活人献祭。殷墟出土的人殉骸骨数以千计。商国人进行田猎活动，捕猎对象，包括生活在他们的殖民据点外面的，不属于其共同体的异族人类。这种活动，不可能只是一种祭祀活动，或是纯粹的打猎娱乐。它对被征服者进行人口控制，保障经济剥削的性质，似乎可以看到斯巴达人和黑劳士之间的影子。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  古代印度的瓦尔纳种姓制度，其中的上面的三个种姓，，第一个：婆罗门，是祭祀；意识形态管理者；第二个，刹帝利，是武士、贵族。这两个种姓，根据雅利安人理论，是欧亚大草原发源的外来征服者，和崇拜牛的风俗有关的，也就是广义的猎人的后代。所谓雅利安人的后代，不一定是血缘上的后代，但是至少是政治和职业上的后代。他们征服了恒河流域，把原生的农业人口置于其统治之下。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  第三个种姓，吠舍，是有公民权的农牧业、工商业者。他们的起源，要么是猎人人群的外围，比土著更早地加入猎人的共同体；要么是猎人和本地人的混血，总之他们是征服者的统战对象。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  第四个种姓，首陀罗。也就是做为被征服者的恒河流域原生农业人口的后代。他们是没有公民权的，不进行成人礼。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>上述的，都是猎人和农人之间的共生关系层次比较分明的情况。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  但是，猎人和农人之间，明显也存在互相统战和融合的可能。在很多现代社会中，已经经过了几代或者几十代的垂直整合，猎人和农人的后代，已经大体融合。但是，这种武士和平民融合的社会，一种看似静态的均质的状态，其实是历史上短暂的状态；而外来秩序的存在，武士和平民的差序分层，对立之中的共生和彼此间动态的演化，倒是更大时间尺度上的常态。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在全世界的城市的中，这种阶级对立共生的痕迹是非常显性的。最通常的形式是城堡。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>古堡，经常被认为具有浪漫色彩，伴随着贵族品德和生活方式。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  但是，你知道，在多数文化里，贵族的祖先，是蛮族，也就是猎人。猎人和农人的共生，成为农人的统治者或者保护人，导致了他们定居在农人之中。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>猎人虽然武勇，但是人数很少。可能只有农人的十分之一、百分之一。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>所以，他们首先要把自己保护起来。防止他们的被保护人，当地的农人翻脸。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  英国，古堡是非常多的。他们当中很多是诺曼人征服英格兰的过程中修建的。诺曼人一路打过去，但是想要凭借他们的万把个武士有效统治一个大国，他们打到那里，就要把城堡修到哪里。1066年到1087年之间，诺曼征服者，在英格兰中部地方修建了36坐城堡。

  满清以几万八旗武士入关，统治上亿的明国百姓。八旗军队，并不是撒胡椒面一样到处都有。在关内，有江宁、福州、杭州、荆州、西安、成都、广州，七个驻防将军，每处有几千士兵。除去这七处，关内还有十几处八旗驻军。他们一般有一个独立的城池。叫满城、或者旗城。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  满城，猎人的城池。在农人的连续聚落的背景下，形成若干孤岛。和古往今来很多文化的武士贵族一样，他们在平民的城市里或者城市旁边形成一个坚固的局部，面积。这些满城是清朝最主要的统治基础。而且，在发生战乱、革命，比如太平天国和辛亥革命的时候，这些满城就要发挥作用。比如南京的满洲八旗用玉石俱焚、全体殉国的方式抵抗太平天国的进攻。
</p>

<p>
  猎人和农人的共生，差不多可以直接和“殖民主义”画等号，似乎是充满矛盾和张力的。但是，这种共生体，体现出了很强的生命力。而且，它不仅是城市最初起源的主要形式，也是很多今日世界城市的前身。伦敦塔，就是诺曼人统治英格兰原住民的堡垒。金中都，或者元大都，明显也是游牧民族在山下农业地区设置的前哨码头。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  也就是说，这种共生体，成为演化系统的主角。恰恰说明这种共生关系中具有秩序和组织要素、效率优势和可持续发展的能力。
