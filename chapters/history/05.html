  I disccussed in the previous issuethat the symbiotic relationship between
  hunters and farmers is the origin of ancient urban communities. Hunters
  constitute the warrior nobility, while farmers form the common people. Many
  heroes in national founding myths are shepherds, such as Israel's David, who
  was the shepherd who killed Goliath with a slingshot. The oldest human
  literature, the hero Enkidu in the Epic of Gilgamesh, is also portrayed as a
  shepherd. They first herded sheep, and after becoming monarchs, they were
  often referred to as "shepherds of the people."

  The audient "blossom in his heart" asked: For a nation, can barbarism overcome
  civilization? For each individual, can cruelty overcome gentleness? This seems
  to carry some undertones of the Dark Forest Law. If that's the case, wouldn't
  it be too gloomy?
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  I will try to answer briefly: Barbarism overcoming civilization is a notion
  that exists, but it may be an excuse made by those who claim to be civilized
  for their failures. But in reality, who is barbaric and who is civilized is
  not easy to determine, so one should not fully believe such assertions.

  Throughout history, people have three types of interactions with history: one,
  those who wield the power and have larger influence to the course of history;
  two, those who are responsible to write and interpret history; and three,
  those who are mostly influenced by the history written by others.

<p>
  People who shape history, such as the Emperor Aguda of the Jin Dynasty, or the
  Dutch East India Company, are few in number, accounting for only 1/1000, but
  they create the main currents of history. However, they don't pay much
  attention to shaping historical records, nor do they create particularly
  complex theories for themselves, and, like some kings of the Carolingian
  Empire, they are not very literate. The phrase "not very literate" is in the
  Latin sense; Charlemagne, of course, was proficient in his own mother tongue,
  it's just that the writing system at the time hadn't yet been established.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Those who write history are usually scholar-officials in China, or left-wing
  intellectuals in the West, with the former generally much more absurd than the
  latter. They are all particularly adept at compiling materials, but they don't
  really understand the actions of those who shape history because they have
  never stood in their shoes. On the contrary, they think their work is very
  important, as they are setting their hearts for the universe and their lives
  for the people. But in fact, the history they write often belittles the true
  creators of history, placing themselves on a particularly high pedestal.

  The number of the general public is much larger, and the version they like or
  can read is what we usually know as history. In this kind of history, those
  who really create history are often portrayed as barbaric and backward.

  For example, many people have a stereotypical impression of the Jin Dynasty as
  nomadic shepherds wearing animal skin hats, but archaeological evidence shows
  that the Jin people's blast furnaces were very advanced. Other information
  beyond history will reveal the truth, such as the description of Jin soldiers
  in folklore stories - "iron butchers", which are entirely French heavy cavalry
  equipment. There are also stories like the "Mengchong warship" ridden by Jin
  Wushu. You can know that the Jin Dynasty was actually very developed in
  manufacturing and shipbuilding, even more developed than the Song Dynasty,
  although they couldn't surpass the Song people in writing lyrics.

  Gentleness does not necessarily lose to cruelty. Generally, being gentle is
  not a bad thing; but weakness and indifference are another matter. They
  essentially reflect people's constant desire to take advantage of loopholes
  and free rides, failing to take on the responsibility of maintaining social
  order, and letting it degenerate and become chaotic. Farmers often lose to
  hunters, and it's not just because of the lack of fighting power of farmers.
  In fact, there are tens or hundreds of times more farmers than hunters. If
  farmers can't beat hunters, it's because they lack organization and the will
  to protect their way of life. They may have been reduced to quasi-slaves
  without initiative in the previous society, and it doesn't matter who their
  master is. The fact is that farmers are not destined to be weak, and it's not
  that farmers are destined to be inferior to hunters. After all, farmers are
  the descendants of hunters, people are all similar, it's just the
  circumstances that are different. If farmers enter the frontier blue ocean,
  they can also become brave pioneers. Like Americans on the East Coast moving
  to the West, they become tough cowboys. Western Japanese farmers may become
  samurai lords when they get to the Kanto region. German farmers who went to
  the Eastern European plains to cultivate became Junker military aristocrats.

<p>
  The lifestyles of farmers and hunters, from the perspective of evolution,
  represent two evolutionary strategies. One is short-term stability but
  long-term fragility, the other carries higher risk but also the potential for
  explosive growth. The combination of these two strategies forms the
  civilization discussed in this program, the social organization platform of
  cities. Their combination forms a division of labor that is not homogeneous,
  but hierarchical.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In reality, the combination of hunters or nomadic tribes and agricultural
  tribes is rich in detail, and it is not necessarily simple, brutal, or
  one-sided.
</p>

<p>
  In the founding myth of Rome, their first leader, Romulus, was a shepherd.
  Moreover, it is said that he was an abandoned child, raised by a she-wolf, and
  that he grew up drinking wolf milk.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Needless to say, you also know, it must have been that shepherd Romulus was
  particularly brave, he had a way with dealing with wolves, so he boasted that
  he grew up drinking wolf milk. Romulus, it is said, was driven out of his
  hometown of Alba by his fellow villagers. He probably was very tenacious, with
  the aura of a mafia boss, you can call him Brother Rom. He and his brother
  mixed with a bunch of bachelor shepherds, and became their leader. Later, they
  built a stronghold on the Palatine Hill by the Tiber River. The Palatine Hill,
  though called a hill, is just a small hill about 30-40 meters high, with a
  relatively flat top, covering an area of 400 by 300 meters, about a dozen
  hectares, any real estate project in China today is larger than this. The
  location of this hill was not chosen randomly, it is west of the Tiber River,
  and on its other three sides, there are wetlands and seasonal ravines between
  it and other hills. So it essentially has a natural moat, which you can't see
  today because the Romans later filled them up to build houses.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Such a place was the greatest center of classical Mediterranean civilization.
  Its extraordinary development is of great interest. As for Romulus, as long as
  his remains were not found with his name or iconic objects, he remains a
  mythical figure. However, even myths are not made up arbitrarily. They must
  have a real background.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Settling in a fortress, for a real shepherd, is not much of an advantage. If
  you want to have a lot of sheep, you need to find a broad valley and live a
  nomadic lifestyle.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Although it's not clear in the historical stories, we can reasonably imagine
  that Romulus shepherd band was not purely herding. There were many settled
  agricultural tribes living around them. Including the Etruscans, Sabines,
  Samnites, and the Latins who spoke the same language as Romulus himself, etc.
  Romulus probably also managed land, hired tenant farmers, and provided them
  with protection. He might also have collected protection fees from nearby
  villages, or provided some judicial services. To provide judicial services,
  you need the ability to enforce judgements, so Romulus should be quite
  competent as a judge, at least for enforcement. In addition, they might also
  trade with the people around them, or serve as bodyguards, debt collectors,
  etc.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In the founding myth of Rome, the first big thing Romulus did after founding
  the city was to snatch a bunch of girls from the neighboring Sabine village at
  a banquet to be their wives. According to current laws, he would be considered
  a full-fledged rapist.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  But in the story, this seems to be a great achievement. Then, the village of
  the kidnapped girls and the Romulus' stronghold had a so-called "war". By that
  time, the Italian region had already entered the Bronze Age, and both sides
  should have some very lethal weapons, but there seemed to be few casualties in
  the battle. In the end, the women could not be taken back, and the fact that
  everyone became relatives could not be changed. So, the people of the Sabine
  village simply moved to Quirinal Hill next to the Palatine Hill, where the
  Italian presidential palace is today, and the two tribes formed a stronghold
  city-state.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Romulus' stronghold city-state, like Water Margin's Liangshan, welcomed anyone
  who came to join. After Romulus' death, the kingship was not passed to his
  son, or even to his shepherd folks. The newly established patricians elected a
  descendant of the Sabine people, who had their daughters kidnapped, Numa, as
  the new king. You can imagine him as Song Jiang being elected by everyone
  after Chao Gai's death. Numa, indeed, was like Song Jiang in the legend. Numa
  didn't like to fight, he was known for his wisdom and piety, a leader who was
  good at ideological management, teaching the Romans to respect the gods and
  lifes.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  We can see that the founding myth of Rome is very classic. The integration of
  hunters and farmers here is not as one-sided as one might think. Romulus
  represents the bravery of hunters, while Numa Pompilius, a Sabine, whose
  people had been settled and engaged in farming for a longer time, are closer
  to a farming tribe. They were not as strong as Romulus' band, and they were
  second in the formation of the symbiotic body, but they were not completely
  passive. The elites among them could at least compete for the position of the
  priest and ideological managers of the sacred land. The process of Rome's
  founding myth is a process of alternating leadership between the religious and
  military powers.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Therefore, farmers in the symbiotic body are not necessarily passive. They
  have a great chance to attain the position of priests. The Germanic barbarians
  ruled the Latin people, but the Latin people infused Christianity into the
  Germanic people and spread it to the north of Europe.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  (* This paragraph talks about "Water Margin", also known as "Outlaws of the
  Marsh". The novel has Chao Gai and Song Jiang as the martial founding leader
  and the intelligent successive leader respectively.)

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  After hunters and farmers form a symbiotic body, they may merge, or even
  completely assimilate.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Hunters were originally protectors and active maintainers of the symbiotic
  body. Their image is both frightening and respectable. However, if they are
  assimilated by farmers, they may lose their warrior traits, becoming hollow
  nobility, appearing redundant and detestable. This signifies the degeneration
  of the urban community and is also the reason why traditional urban
  communities lose stability and move towards destruction. This process of
  martial virtue degeneration is particularly fast on the North China Plain,
  from Dorgon to Qianlong, it only takes about 100 years, three to four
  generations. To reach exhaustion and extinction, it can hold out for another
  hundred years. It is also extremely rapid in the fertile plains of Mesopotamia
  and the Nile. From the time Cyrus II occupied Babylon to the cultural
  prosperity of the Artaxerxes era, it is 100 years. Then to the extinction of
  Darius III, it is another 100 years.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In the hilly areas, where farming and herding are mixed, and the elements of
  commerce and the sea are richer, it seems to be slower. For instance, the case
  of Rome, from its founding in the 8th century BC, to the Roman Empire period,
  when fighting was mainly dependent on barbarian generals, it took seven to
  eight hundred years. Or in the Isle of France, from the time the Capetian
  knights took the throne, to the Louis XVI era, when the king and nobles were
  abandoned by the citizens, it was also about 800 years.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The order vacuum caused by the loss of warriors will be filled by others. One
  of the candidates is monks, or priests. In troubled times, monks often arm
  themselves to maintain order, similar to the historical background of the
  Shaolin Temple on Mount Song.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  If the monk group is especially successful, they may even seize its world.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  That's the case with Egypt's 21st Dynasty, the citeis they left behind are
  mostly huge temples, Luxor and Karnak;
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Japan's so-called Sengoku daimyō, in essence, were armed landlords. In places
  closer to the capital, where the landlord's armed forces are relatively weak.
  The influence of temples has surpassed that of the landlord militias, and even
  that of the court. A large number of people depended on monasteries, even to
  the point of forming monastery cities. Japan's big city, Osaka, was originally
  built by the warrior monk group, Ishiyama Hongan-ji.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In Europe, we often see monasteries that are exactly like castles. They also
  count as traces of the survival of temple congregations in troubled times.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  We know that Zhu Yuanzhang developed from the rebel army of the Ming Sect
  (Manichaeism). However, after Zhu Yuanzhang seized the world, he actually
  suppressed the Ming Sect. If he hadn't done this, today there might still be
  many land temples worshipping Maitreya Buddha, Mazda altars look like the
  Temple of Heaven, or Confucius or Zhang Tianshi statues being called the Left
  Envoy of Light. (*joke from the novel The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber by Jin
  Yong)
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In addition to this, the underworld and grassroots police officers may also
  fill the vacuum and become rulers. Heroes like Liu Bang, Li Zicheng, and Cheng
  Yaojin emerged.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  More directly, it is the armed colonists from outside. You can call them
  conquerors, or barbarian immigrants. Whether called Libyans, Nubians, Hyksoss,
  Dorians, Aryans, Huns, Goths, Franks, Lombards, Normans, Russ, Xianbeis,
  Magyars Humans, Ottomans, Mughals, Jurchens, or something like that could be
  hundreds of, recurring patterns.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Once the new hunters become the rulers, the next cycle of assimilation with
  the peasants begins.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The above are some supplements to the symbiotic interaction between hunters
  and farmers.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>
  上期我们说到了，猎人和农人的共生体，是上古城市共同体的起源。猎人构成武士贵族、农人构成平民。建国神话的英雄，很多都是牧羊人，比如以色列的大卫，就是那个用弹弓打死歌莉娅的羊倌；人类最古老的文学，Gilgamesh史诗里面的英雄Enkidu，也是羊倌的形象。他们先是放牧羊群，成为君主之后，经常被称为“人民的牧者”。

  网友“心里开着花”问：&nbsp;对于国家来说，是野蛮能战胜文明？对于每个个体人，是残忍能战胜温和吗？有点黑暗森林法则的意思。是这样的话，会不会太灰暗了？
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  我稍微回答一下：野蛮战胜文明，有这种说法，不过，这有可能是自称文明的人为自己的失败找的理由。但是其实谁野蛮、谁文明，是不太好说。所以这种话不能全信。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  历史上掌握现实话语权、左右历史进程的人，负责编写历史负责历史解释权的人，还有看别人写的历史的人，是三种人。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  左右历史的人，比如金国的完颜阿骨打，比如荷兰的东印度公司；他们的人数是不多的，只占1/1000，但是历史的主要潮流都是他们制造的。不过，他们不太注意去左右历史记录，也没为自己创造出特别复杂的理论，甚至如同查理曼帝国的一些君王一样，不太会写字。所谓不太会写字，也是拉丁文意义上的，查理曼自己的母语他当然是运用自如的，只不过当时书写系统还没固定下来。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  而编写历史的，在中国一般是科举士大夫、在西方对应左派知识分子，当然前者一般比后者荒谬得多。他们都，特别擅长编写材料，但是他们对于左右历史的人的行为其实并不理解，因为他们根本没有站到那个位置上，相反他们觉得自己的工作特别重要，是为天地立心、为生民立命。但是事实上，他们编写的历史，经常贬低真正的历史的创造者，把自己摆在特别高的地位。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>他们一面误导吃瓜群众，一面培养出新一代科举士大夫和左派文人。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  而吃瓜群众的数量多得多，他们喜闻乐见的或者他们唯一能够读到的版本，就是我们通常知道的历史。在这种历史上，真正创造历史的人经常被说成是野蛮、落后的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  就好像，很多人对金国的刻板印象就是一些带着兽皮帽子的牧民；但是，考古证据说明金人的高炉非常发达。还有很多历史之外的信息会露出真相，比如演义故事里对金兵的描述——铁浮屠，完全是法国重甲骑兵的装备。还有比如金兀术乘坐的“艨艟战舰”之类的故事。你可以知道，金国其实是制造业和造船业是非常发达的，甚至比宋人还要发达。虽然他们写歌词是写不过宋人的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  而温和败给残忍，这也是不一定的。一般情况下，温和是没什么坏处的；但是软弱和麻木不仁是另外一个问题，它本质上是人总是想等着钻空子和搭便车，不能承担维持社会秩序的责任，任由其退化和混乱。农人经常败给猎人，也不光是农人的战斗力不行，事实上农民比猎人多几十倍，几百倍，打不过猎人，一是他们缺乏组织，二是他们没有保护自己生活方式的意志。因为他们可能在之前的社会里沦为失去主动性的准奴隶，主人换谁都一样。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  事实上农人并不注定是软弱的，不是说农人就注定低猎人一等。农人说到底也是猎人的后代，人都是差不多的，只是境遇不同。如果农人进入边疆蓝海，他们也可以变成武勇的开拓者。好像东岸的美国人进入西部，就成为彪悍的牛仔。日本西部农民到了关东地区就可能成为武士大名。去东欧平原开拓的德意志农民，会成为容克军事贵族。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  罗马农民逃到海滩里的沙洲上避难，建立了航海立国的威尼斯共和国，称霸东地中海四五百年。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  农人和猎人的生活方式，演化论的视角看，是两种演化策略。一种是短期稳定然而长期脆弱，另一种是风险较高但是蕴藏着爆发增长的机会。这两种策略的组合，形成的文明，是这个节目讲的城市的社会组织平台。他们的组合，构成一种职业分工，不是均质的，而是分层次的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在现实中，猎人或者游牧民族和农业民族组合是细节丰富的，不一定都是简单、残暴和一边倒的。

  罗马的建国神话中，他们的第一位领袖Romulus是一个羊倌，而且，据称他是弃婴，被母狼收养，他喝狼奶长大的。

  不用多说，你也知道，想必是羊倌Romulus胆子特别大，他对付狼很有一套，于是吹牛说自己是喝狼奶长大的。罗穆露斯，据说是被乡亲们从他的老家阿尔巴赶出来的。他大概是很有拼劲，带有黑社会大哥气质，你可以叫他罗哥。他和他的兄弟混在一堆光棍牧羊人中间，成为他们的领袖。后来，他们在台伯河边的帕拉丁山上修建了一座山寨。帕拉丁山，名字叫山，但是也就是三四十米高的小丘，山顶比较平坦，面积是400米乘以300米，大概十几个公顷的地方，今天中国随便一个房地产项目，都不止这么大。这座山丘的位置，当然不是随便选的，它西面是台伯河，另外三面，是和其他山丘之间的湿地和季节性的冲沟。所以它基本上是有天然的一圈护城河，你今天去是看不到这些水沟的，因为后来罗马人为了盖房子都填平了。

  这样一个地方，就是古典时代地中海文明的最大中心。他的超常发育，是很有关注价值的。Romulus，只要他的遗体没有和名字或者标志性的器物一起被出图，他就是一个神话人物。但是，即便神话，也不是随便编的。他必然有其真实的背景。

  定居在一个山寨里，对于一个真正放羊的人，其实是没什么好处的。你要想有特别多的羊，就要找一个宽阔的山谷，逐水草而居吗。
</p>

<p>
  虽然历史故事里没说清楚，我们可以合理的想象，罗哥的牧羊人队伍，应该不是单纯的放牧。他们周围居住着很多的农业定居部落。包括伊特鲁里亚、萨宾、萨姆尼特还有和罗穆露斯本人语言相通的拉丁人等等。romulus很可能也开辟了土地，招聘佃农，并且为他们提供保护。他也可能收取附近村庄的保护费。或者提供一些司法服务。要搞司法服务，就需要有强制执行判决的能力，所以罗哥应该很胜任法官的。此外，他们也可能和周围的人进行贸易、或者充当保镖、打手之类的工作。

  在罗马的建国神话中，罗哥建城后干的第一件大事，就是在酒宴上抢走一批隔壁萨宾村庄的姑娘做老婆。根据现在的法律，他就是一个十足的强奸犯。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  但是在故事中，这似乎是一大功绩。然后，被抢姑娘的村庄和罗氏山寨发生了所谓的“战争”。当时已经意大利地区已经进入了青铜时代，双方应该有一些杀伤性很强的兵器，但是，战斗中似乎伤亡不大。最终，女人抢不回来了，大家成为亲戚的事实也无法改变。于是这个萨宾人村庄的人索性搬到了帕拉丁山隔壁的quirinal山，也就是今天意大利总统府那里，两个部落结成了一个山寨城邦。
</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  罗哥的山寨城邦和水泊梁山一样，谁来投靠都欢迎。罗哥去世之后，国王大位，也不是传给儿子的，甚至也没有传给众羊倌兄弟。众好汉选举被抢姑娘的一方，萨宾人的后代，弩马为新的国王。你可以把他想象成晁盖死后大家推举宋江。弩马，确实也像宋江一样，在传说中，弩马不喜欢打仗，他以智慧和虔诚著称，是一位善于进行意识形态管理的领袖，教导罗马人尊重神、尊重生命。

  我们看出，罗马的建国神话，是非常经典的。这里面猎人和农人整合没有那么纯粹的一边倒。Romulus代表猎人的武勇，而numa
  pompilius，是萨宾人，他们比羊倌好汉定居和从事农业的时间要长，更接近于农人部落，战斗力不如罗哥的帮派，在共生体的形成中，处于第二位，但是也不是完全被动。他们中的精英，至少可以竞争圣地的祭司、意识形态管理者的位置。罗马的建国神话的过程，就是文武张弛、交替领导的过程。
</p>

<p>
  所以农人，在共生体中不是注定被动的。他们得到祭司地位的机会很大。日耳曼蛮族政府了拉丁人，但是拉丁人把基督教注入日耳曼人，并且向欧洲北方传播。

<p>而猎人和农人在形成共生体之后，会发生融合，甚至完全同化。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  猎人本来是保护人，是共生体的积极维护者。他们的形象是可怕又可敬的。但是，他们被农人同化，就有可能失去了他们的武士特征，成为贵族的空壳，显得多余和可憎。这意味着城市共同体的退化。也是传统城市共同体丧失稳定，走向破灭的原因。这个武德退化过程，在华北平原，一般特别快，多尔衮到乾隆，只需要100年时间，三四代人。再到耗尽灭亡，还可以坚持一百多年。在两河流域和尼罗河肥沃的原野上，也非常迅速的。从居鲁士二世占领巴比伦到亚达薛斯时代文化繁荣。是100年。再到大流士三世灭亡，也是100年的时间。

<p>
  而在丘陵地区，农牧混杂，商业和海洋元素比较丰富的地方，似乎可以慢一些。比如，罗马的案例，则慢得多，从公元前8世纪建国，到罗马帝国时期，退化到打仗主要靠蛮族武将，花了七八百年时间。或者在法兰西岛，从卡佩家族的武士取得王位，到路易十六时代，国王和贵族被市民抛弃，也是800年左右。

  失去武士产生的秩序真空，会被其他人填补。候选人之一，是僧人、或者叫祭司。在乱世之中，僧人经常会自我武装，来维持秩序。就像嵩山少林寺类似的历史背景。

  那就是古埃及的第21王朝的种情况，他们留下城市，主要就是巨大的神庙，它们就是我们熟悉的luxor和卡纳克；

  日本的所谓战国大名，本质上就是地主团练。在比较接近京城的地方，地主武装比较弱的地方。寺院的影响力超过了地主团练，也超过了官僚朝廷。形成大量百姓依附于寺院，乃至于形成城市。日本的大城市，大阪；他原来的主人，就是武僧集团，石山本愿寺。

  在欧洲我们经常看到，和城堡一模一样的修道院。他们也算寺院组合自己教民，在乱世中生存的痕迹。

  我们知道朱元璋，是在明教的起义军中发展出来的。只不过，朱元璋夺取天下之后，反而封杀了明教。如果他没有这么做，今天可能也会留下很多拜弥勒佛的土地庙，像天坛一样的马自达祭坛，或者被称为光明左使的孔子或者张天师。

  除此之外，黑社会、基层民警，也有可能填补真空，成为统治者。涌现出刘邦、李自成、程咬金之类的豪杰。

  更加直接的，是外来的武装殖民者，你说是征服者，或者蛮族移民都可以。不管叫利比亚人、努比亚人、喜客索斯人、多利亚人、雅利安人、匈奴人、哥特人、法兰克人、伦巴地人、诺曼人、罗斯人、鲜卑人、马扎儿人、奥斯曼人、莫卧耳人、女真人，或者诸如此类的可能数以百计，重复发生的模式。
