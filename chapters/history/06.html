<h1>06 A Game of Casting Risks, the Calculation on Castle Building</h1>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, I will delve into the discourse of castles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  While palpable remnants of fortresses like Qianmen Gate Tower in Beijing, the
  city walls and gates of Xi'an and Nanjing are prominent, a significant portion
  of the Chinese populace may not view the castle as a recurrent urban landscape
  (in contrast to Europe or Japan).
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Indeed, within the borders of China, a multitude of castles have been built
  historically. We know that many noble families of the Han dynasty had
  fortresses, and numerous clay fortress models have been found in Han tombs;
  many local magnates in later dynasties also constructed fortresses, some of
  their designs bear an resemblance to those of Norman castles. Even today place
  names designated as a certain fortress or stockade are still common.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Of course, the majority of these ancient fortresses have unfortunately
  succumbed to the passage of time. Nonetheless, even today, castles can still
  be glimpsed in China:
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  For instance, the weisuos( guard camps) of the Ming dynasty, characterized by
  its rather simplistic block design, traces of which can still be witnessed in
  places like Yantai and Xiamen( Amoi). The renowned Kowloon Walled City of
  Hongkong, which has since been dismantled, was one such fortress. These weisuo
  fortresses are relatively low in military engineering sophistication, with
  designs that are monotonous and elementary.

  Another type comprises various local fortresses constructed by local
  chieftains, landlords, and village collectives. They typically utilize the
  natural terrain, and their designs are richer and more complex. The most
  well-known among these are probably the earthen buildings ( tulous) of
  Zhangzhou in Fujian, and the diaolou clusters in Kaiping, Canton. This
  category of local fortresses, albeit numerous, tend to be smaller in scale and
  are often situated in regions where the imperial order could not reach, hence
  exhibiting a pronounced need for organized-self-defense among the locals.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Such places are generally remote from large cities, hence the presence of
  these fortresses may not be particularly conspicuous.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The existence of castles, however, is far more overt in Europe. Countless
  cities, such as Edinburgh, Budapest, and Lisbon, are dominated by their
  imposing castle skylines. In England, Wales, along the Rhine or in the
  Apennine Mountains, the remnants of various fortresses from successive
  dynasties are so numerous and densely scattered that they are within mutual
  sight. While there are many ancient castles among those currently standing in
  Europe, most were constructed after the 11th century.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In cities across Japan, irrespective of their size, it is typical to find one
  or several remnants of castles. According to a statistic I came across, there
  exist over 100 various castles in contemporary Japan, while historically, the
  number surpasses 5000. Japanese castles primarily emerged within a relatively
  concentrated time frame that was later than their European counterparts, with
  the majority erected during the 16th century. This was a period subsequent to
  the import of European technology during the Age of Exploration, and before
  the Tokugawa shogunate's policy of self isolation.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The best-preserved castles in Japan today, such as Kumamoto Castle and Himeji
  Castle, which I have had the opportunity to visit, are renowned for their
  massive earthworks and architectural scale, as well as the intricacy of their
  military technological details. They suggest a serious preparation for
  extensive warfare. The original owners of these two fortresses were not
  Japan's most powerful lords; for a feudal city-state with a population merely
  ranging from tens of thousands to a few hundred thousand, the commitment and
  expenditure involved in such construction projects is truly astounding.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  One may glean an impression that, barring new world countries like the United
  States, the Old World's developed countries seem to abound in castles.
  <strong
    >The more developed is the country, the more abundant are its
    castles.</strong
  >
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  From an empirical perspective, one could even propose a hypothesis: Could the
  construction of castles in every village have stimulated development?
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How should we interpret this phenomenon?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aren't castles symbols of warfare and militarism?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Feudal lords in Europe and Japan were considerably impoverished compared to
  the great monarchs and emperors of China and India. Yet, even without the
  pressing threat of imminent warfare, they were willing to refrain themselves
  on other expensese, accumulate massive debt, all to build their formidable
  fortresses.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Certainly, these efforts were not in vain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let us examine how castles altered the political climate of city-states:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  For any monarch aiming to seize another's castle, the calculation required is
  analogous to that of a modern company undertaking a merger or acquisition.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  He would have to evaluate the costs and benefits. Seizing a castle would yield
  an additional source of income. However, the process of seizing also entails
  costs. Having acquired another's company, if you wish to gain genuine control,
  it necessitates the restructuring of its management, an action which incurs
  substantial costs.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  To forcibly capture a city-state generally requires having military forces
  several times larger than the opponent's, as the radius of your siege circle
  is significantly larger than the opponent's defense circle. This vast width
  necessitates a much larger number of soldiers. Furthermore, while besieging
  the opponent's city, you also need to construct earthworks around the city to
  prevent surprise attacks, typically beyond the range of the city's defenses
  projectiles. This enlarges the radius of the siege works. Although possibly
  far more rudimentary than a permanent castle, features like ditches, walls,
  and watchtowers are generally indispensable. All of this roughly amounts to
  the cost of constructing half a castle.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  You must also be prepared to counter potential reinforcements attacking from
  behind. Sometimes, behind the besieging troops, another line of defensive
  works is constructed, akin to building a larger ring fortress outside the
  opponent's city.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This forms the standard configuration for a siege.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In 52 BC, Caesar commanded the Roman legions to besiege the Gauls in Alesia.
  The perimeter of the Gauls' fortress was approximately two to three
  kilometers; Caesar surrounded it and built the first ring of siege works,
  termed 'circumvallation', spanning 16 kilometers, composed of trenches, walls,
  and watchtowers, to prevent enemy breakouts from the city. Then, to block the
  Gauls' reinforcements from outside, the Roman legions constructed another
  21-kilometer long defensive work called 'contravallation'. This secured
  Caesar's 70,000 besieging troops between the two walls and put the Gauls of
  Alesia under a long-term siege.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Caesar's case was successful. He first defeated the Gauls' reinforcements
  relying on the fortress and then, as the Gauls inside Alesia were numerous but
  their food supplies limited and breakout attempts hopeless, they could not
  outlast Caesar and eventually surrendered.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  However, in most cases, a castle would not house too many people. It would
  have a well for secured drinking water supply and food storage to last for
  years. If you use tens of thousands of people to besiege a few thousand inside
  the castle for months, with the cost being ten times that of the enemy, it
  would not be economically beneficial even if you take the stronghold
  eventually.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In 1565, the Ottoman Empire's navy carried 40,000 soldiers to land on the
  island of Malta. The defenders were the 600 Knights Hospitaller from Malta and
  over 2,000 soldiers from various Christian countries in Europe, along with
  3,000 armed islanders, totaling six to seven thousand. After four months of
  siege, although the defenders were exhausted and reduced in number, the
  Ottoman army had also suffered over half casualties, and infectious diseases
  were rampant. When the European reinforcements landed on Malta, the Ottoman
  Empire had to retreat.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  To take a castle, you need a significant political advantage, material
  reserves, and be prepared to pay a high cost. Failure means mutual loss, with
  the besieging party's cost being many times that of the defenders.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  For any monarch of any major country, mobilizing 40,000 fully-armed soldiers
  to besiege a city-state for a year and a half is a major undertaking that
  could easily cause political fluctuations and unforeseeable risks. Such
  actions cannot be frequently undertaken. Generally, forcibly occupying a city
  will be economically disadvantageous unless there is a particularly strong
  political significance. Attacks on castles are rarely forced; in the English
  Wars of the Roses, the red and white armies often bypassed enemy castles and
  rarely dared to storm them.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The essence of a castle, obviously, is not for someone to attack; on the
  contrary, its existence is to prevent attacks, so it must be intimidating and
  appear strong.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Today, in architecture, a coating that looks like stone is often used to paint
  the exterior walls, making it look more expensive. This technique can be said
  to be a completely traditional craft, because a thousand years ago, knights in
  England were painting coatings on wooden castles to disguise them as stone
  castles.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  If you are a lord, what you have to do is to let everyone know that it's a
  losing deal to forcefully take your castle. If your territory generates a
  profit of $1,000,000 a year, then, according to the investment market
  valuation, your valuation might be $15,000,000. What you need to ensure is
  that the cost for your opponent to take your castle exceeds $15,000,000.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  For example, you could say to your adversaries: "Let me tell you, this piece
  of land of mine garners at most £1,000,000 in tax revenue per year. I have
  spent £5,000,000 over five years, living frugally, to build this castle. If
  you want to conquer me, you must spend at least £50,000,000. Certainly, you
  don't have £50,000,000. If you borrow it from the Bank of England, they would
  charge you £5,000,000 in interest per year, making your venture a guaranteed
  loss. However, if you decide to make peace with me, I can provide you with 50
  smoked swans each year as a tribute. So, I suggest you consider my
  proposition."
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Thus, a castle may appear to be a military hardware at first glance, but in
  fact, it is a peacekeeping and order-maintaining instrument. In reality, most
  castles in Europe have never been assaulted. In countries densely dotted with
  castles, like France during the Middle Ages, the nation was fundamentally
  structured from the ground up, as described by Machiavelli, such a country is
  hard to destroy. Even if the royal family perishes, the essence of the country
  still exists in its thousands of rural castles, and national order can be
  easily restored from them. On the contrary, like Darius of Persia, in a
  country lacking militarily independent city-states, once the emperor falls,
  the imperial structure crumbles, quickly falling into Alexander's hands.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Constructing a castle does carry significant costs, but it serves as a
  resource for stability. It's much more economically feasible than enduring
  catastrophic warfare and totalitarian oppression.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  How to design a castle using the least amount of money, yet imposing a
  significant cost on the opponent, that is the art of castle building.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In this episode, I introduce the basic form of castles, which encapsulates the
  fundamental principles of castle construction.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  This is the straightforward design known as the "Motte and Bailey,"
  constructed by the Normans in the 10th and 11th centuries across France and
  the Great Britain.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  These are two peculiar French-like terms that lack corresponding words in
  Chinese. You could refer to them as "high fortress and ground fortress."
  However, using the familiar Japanese terminology may be more explanatory -
  they're equivalent to Honmaru and Ninomaru.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Assume you're a baron or a similarly ranked landlord, you could find a steep
  little hill within your territory; if you can't find one, you could pile up
  soil yourself, the higher the better. This is your Motte, the high fortress or
  Honmaru. You could dig soil around the hill in a circle and pile it up in the
  middle, hence while piling up the soil, you're also digging a trench. The edge
  of the slope should be vertical to prevent anyone from climbing it with bare
  hands. A wall is then built on top of the earthen slope. Inside the wall is a
  tall tower, called a "Keep" in English, or a "Tenshukaku" (Castle Tower)
  following Japanese terminology. From the Tenshukaku, you can overlook several
  to tens of kilometers, ideally marking your territory visible at your land's
  border.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The ground floor of the Tenshukaku is typically a warehouse, kitchen, and
  granary. It also stores wine, which could serve as a long-term consumable if
  there's no fresh water source - water stored long-term was hazzardous.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  As an aside, the word "chateau" used for wineries comes from French,
  equivalent to the English "castle," hence winemaking and wine storage were
  common functions of a castle.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Back to the Tenshukaku, the middle floor is where the master and his family
  reside. In any ancient European castle you visit, the master resides on the
  second floor( or first floor per British english).
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The attic or top floor houses the service staff and sentries.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Sometimes, there can be more than three floors, with four or five layers,
  including a basement, a treasury, and a prison for holding important
  prisoners. In the War of the Roses, for example, opposing kings like Henry VI
  were confined in the Tower of London. The highest part of the Tower of London
  is called the White Tower, which is a Keep or Tenshukaku.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The area of the Motte or Honmaru is often very small, only a few hundred to a
  few thousand square meters, unless for a Shogun or the Emperor of Ming with
  many wives, then he would need tens of thousands of square meters inside your
  Honmaru to accommodate his harem. However, for a small landlord, the Honmaru
  and the Tenshukaku are never large.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  To accommodate other functions, a larger courtyard must be built in addition
  to the Motte or Honmaru. This courtyard, slightly higher than the ground
  level, has its own wall and trench, and its own arrow towers on the wall. This
  is referred to as the Bailey, the lower fortress, or Ninomaru.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

</figure>
<!-- /wp:embed -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Between the Ninomaru and the Honmaru, there is also a trench, and one must
  cross a bridge and climb steep steps to reach the Honmaru. This is normally
  the only route to the Honmaru.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Inside the Ninomaru, there's typically:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  <strong>A well</strong>—this is crucial; every castle needs an independent
  water source, unaffected and unharmed by outside enemies. Even if a castle is
  located on a hill, it's usually a small hill, as very few are located on high
  mountains. This is mainly due to the limited access to fresh water.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  <strong>A blacksmith</strong> for weaponery, and more often just for weapon
  repair.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  <strong>A stable</strong>, as a small castle usually houses a few cavalrymen.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  <strong>A hall</strong>: it serves as a court, a meeting room, and a banquet
  hall.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  <strong>A chapel:</strong> for conducting ideological and political work.
  Several soldier dormitories.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Layered Defense</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The Bailey, ground castle or Ninomaru, is the same concept with three names.
  So is the motte, high castle or Honmaru.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The Ninomaru is larger in diameter and lower than the Honmaru, making it
  easier for enemies to breach. But even if enemies break through the Ninomaru,
  it's not yet the end. Those defending the castle can all retreat to the
  Honmaru. With the stored food and wine there, they can hold out for several
  months.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  All that can be damaged in the Ninomaru are most building assets. There are no
  treasures, important figures, or prisoners.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Also, the entire interior of Ninomaru is exposed to the range of the Honmaru.
  Those in the Honmaru have the advantage of height, making it significantly
  advantageous to hit those below. Therefore, even if the attackers invade the
  Ninomaru, they can't hold it. They are very likely to be repelled by the
  defending army from above.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  If you want to end the battle, you still need to have the ability to breach
  the Honmaru and storm the Tenshukaku.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The Motte, Tenshukaku, and Honmaru - only occupy 20% of the total castle area,
  requiring only a few people for defense, but the shooting range is 100%. Its
  defense is 100%, range 100%, requiring over half of the total cost of the
  castle. It can be defended by a small but loyal troop.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The Bailey, or Ninomaru - occupies 80% of the castle area and extensive
  functionality, but only costs the rest half of the total. Its defense is
  weaker, but it's sufficient to ward off 90% of the most common mobs and
  bandits. When the enemy is particularly strong, the Ninomaru can be abandoned
  without leading to a total defeat.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Motte and Bailey model has various modifications.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  This structure can be expanded and upgraded. If the Ninomaru is not enough, it
  can be expanded layer after layer, with outer layers like the Sannomaru,
  Nishinomaru, Kitanomaru..(third, west, and north enclosures...), setting up
  multiple barriers for the enemy, forming a snail-like structure. The moat can
  change from one ring to two. The wall can change from one layer to two, and
  two to three. However, the outer wall must be shorter than the inner one. The
  deeper the defense, the more solid and expensive it is. 80% of the cost is
  used to deal with 20% of the most vicious enemies, while 20% of the cost
  covers 80% of the functions.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  To protect the merchants and industrialists affiliated with the nobility, the
  outermost wall encompasses the civilian blocks. Because this is the lowest
  part within the city, it's referred to as the down town.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1) Cost Logic:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  If you spend one unit of currency, you can get a checkpoint with a 50%
  probability of successful defense; however, if you spend another unit of
  currency, you won't get a 100% success rate, maybe just 70%. When you spend
  three units of currency, you get an 80% successful defense rate checkpoint.
  The marginal benefit is diminishing.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Thus, it's better to spend the same three units of currency on creating three
  checkpoints, each with a 50% successful defense rate. In this case, the
  enemy's success rate of breaking through all checkpoints is the cube of 50%,
  i.e., 12.5%. This means that the overall success rate of your defense is
  87.5%.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is why advanced castles are layered with checkpoints and traps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The simple city walls like those in Ming Dynasty county cities, which are just
  a single layer, are mainly for dealing with bandits and civilians.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In theory, you could make the entire city as grand and sturdy as the
  Tenshukaku, but that would be too expensive. Besides, your resources are
  finite. With the same expenditure, this would inevitably not be the plan
  covering the maximum defensive area. If you only adhere to the standards of
  the Ninomaru, the defense ability is too lax. The safety threshold your total
  investment achieves is too low. Therefore, you must strategically invest your
  funds. The same goes for real estate; the interior and exterior of a
  residential complex's gate, areas frequently passed by people, can be
  decorated with expensive and exquisite landscaping. However, other parts of
  the complex can use modest lawns and plants. The first and second layers of a
  building's exterior walls, parts that people can view up close, should use the
  most expensive materials; but the higher parts can use cost-saving materials,
  as long as they look good from a distance. This is a general principle of cost
  allocation.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  2) Customer Perspective: The customers of the castle are the invaders. Among
  them, small thieves are very common, and the castle as a whole needs to be
  unshakeable in the face of such petty rebellions; powerful enemies that could
  annihilate a country are rare. When facing such formidable enemies, it's
  inevitable to suffer minor losses, but you should be able to maintain your
  core territory. If you aim not to suffer any loss in the face of a powerful
  enemy, the cost would be unbearable.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  3) Loyalty Structure: The same applies to your team. Those most loyal to you,
  ready to die for your country, are few, so don't expect many people to hold
  your final position for you. You need a small, loyal, and efficient team to
  defend a small but formidable stronghold. The majority of the less important
  facilities can only be guarded by peripheral followers.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  4) Irreversible Structure: All cities with three layers of city walls have the
  inner wall taller than the outer one. The outer face of the city wall has
  extensive protections, while the inward direction is mostly exposed. Enemies
  may occupy the outer wall, but before they can enter the inner wall, they must
  cross a deadly trap.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Castles come in various sizes, but this layered structure is the most mature
  pattern in history.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  I often talk about Rome's Palatine Hill and Capitoline Hill. The Capitoline
  Hill is small but high; the Palatine Hill is large but low. The two are
  adjacent, separated by a moat.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  Isn't this the Motte and Bailey structure? Capitoline Hill is clearly Rome's
  high castle. In reality, Rome was rarely attacked. The only time it fell was
  in 390 BC when the Gallic army occupied most of the city. At that time, Rome's
  young soldiers retreated to the narrow top of Capitoline Hill, where they held
  out for seven months. The Gauls eventually withdrew without capturing this
  high fort.

<p>下面，我来讲一讲城堡。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  虽然，有像北京的前门城楼、西安、南京的城墙城门这些明显的城池遗迹。很多中国人可能并不认为城堡是一种非常常见的城市景观。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  其实，中国境内也存在过很多的城堡。我们知道汉代很多世家大族都有坞堡，汉墓也出图一些陶土坞堡模型；后世的土豪也很多建筑坞堡，有些的设计，和诺曼人的城堡设计几乎没什么不同。叫某寨或者某堡的地名非常之多。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  当然古代的坞堡现在大多湮灭不见了。即便如此，今天的中国，仍然能看到一些城堡：
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  比如是明代的卫所，是一种相当简单的方块设计，在烟台、厦门之类的地方还可以看见其痕迹，著名的被拆掉的九龙城寨，也是这类堡垒之一，这种卫所的军事工程技术含量是很低的，设计也非常单调，非常幼稚。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  另外一类，是各种土司、地主、村民团体修造的民间坞堡。他们一般依山就势、因地制宜，其设计更加丰富和复杂；其中最为人所知的，大概是福建漳州的土楼，和广东开平的碉楼群。这类民间坞堡，其实数量巨大，但是规模不是很大，往往分布在帝国秩序无法顾及，而民间自我防卫的需求非常突出的地区。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>这样的地方一般也是偏僻的地区，所以他们的存在似乎不是特别醒目。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  城堡这种东西的存在，在欧洲更加显性。像爱丁堡、布达佩斯、里斯本、这样的笼罩在其庞大城堡的天际线之下的城市，不可胜数。在英格兰、威尔士、在莱茵河上、在亚平宁山区历朝历代，残存的各种堡垒的遗迹车载斗量、不计其数，密集到可以相互对望的程度。欧洲现存的重要的城堡，不乏非常古老的，但是多数是11世纪以后建造的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  日本的城市，不论大小，一般都有一处或者几处城堡的遗迹。我看到一个统计，日本现有各种城堡100多座，而历史上5000多处。日本的城堡，时间窗口比较集中，而且普遍比欧洲的城堡要晚近，多数是16世纪，也就是大航海时代欧洲技术传入日本之后，而在德川幕府闭关锁国之前。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  今天日本保存最好的几个城堡，我都参观过，像熊本城、姬路城，其土方和建筑工程量都极其庞大，其军事技术细节也非常复杂。看起来是要非常严肃的大打一仗的架势。它们当初的主人，都不是日本最大的诸侯；对于一个人口不过几万、最多几十万的封建城邦，进行这样的工程的决心和消耗非常惊人的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  给人的印象似乎是，除去美国这类新大陆国家之外，在旧大陆上，发达国家城堡特别多，越发达的国家城堡越多。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>从实证主义的角度，你几乎可以得出一种假设：村村修城堡难道促进了发展。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>这种现象应该怎样解读呢？</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>城堡，不是战乱和穷兵黩武的象征吗？</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  欧洲和日本的封建诸侯，和中国或者印度的大君大皇帝相比，是非常穷的。但是就算他们没有什么眼前的战争迫在眉睫，他们也愿意节衣缩食，十年时间不吃不喝，欠下巨额债务，构筑其金城汤池。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>这活当然不是白干的。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>我们来看一下，城堡，是怎样改变城邦的政治形势的：</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  任何一个君主，要夺取一个别人的城堡；他要进行的计算和一个现代公司的并购是差不多的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  他要计算成本和收益。夺取一个城堡，会增加一份收入。但是夺取的过程，也是有成本。你收购了对方的公司，如果你要真实的控制，还需要改组他的管理层，这种改组同样有巨大的成本。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  要强行夺取一个城邦，一般，你要包围对方，首先要有数倍于对方的兵力。因为你的包围圈的半径比对方防御圈的半径要大得多，在这样的宽度上，你需要多得多的士兵。然后，你包围对方的城池的时候，为了防止对方突袭，也要修建围城的土木工程。通常是在城堡的射程之外。这样，围城的工程的半径也大得多。虽然，可能比永久性的城堡简陋得多，但是壕沟、围墙、瞭望塔一般是不能缺少的。这一套下来，基本也要花掉修半个城堡的钱。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  你还要防范对方的援军从背后杀过来，有的时候，在围城部队背后，还要再修一圈防御工事。相当于修了半径更大的环形城池，套在对方城池的外面。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>这就是围城的标准配置。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  52BC，凯撒指挥罗马军团围攻阿雷西亚的高卢人。高卢人的堡垒，周长大概两三公里；凯撒将其包围，修筑的第一圈围城工事，是为了组织城里敌人突围，术语交circumvallation，周长是16公里，他就是一圈壕沟、围墙、瞭望塔组成的；然后，为了阻挡外面的高卢援军，罗马军团又修了周长21公里的防御工事，术语叫contravallation。把自己的7万人的围城部队保护在两圈围墙之间。对阿雷西亚的高卢人实施长期围困。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  当然，凯撒的案例是成功的，他首先依靠堡垒，击败了高卢人的援军，然后，因为阿雷西亚城里的高卢人很多，但是存粮不多，而且突围无望。所以他们耗不过凯撒，最终开城投降。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  但是，在更常见的情况下。一座合格的城堡里，人并不会太多，会有水井，提供安全长久的饮水。同时要有够吃几年的粮食。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>你用几万人围着城里面几千人耗粮食，成本是对方的10倍。是非常划不来的。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  1565年，奥斯曼帝国海军载着40000大军，登陆马耳他岛；防守的是马耳他的医院骑士团和欧洲各基督教国家的3000多士兵，加上3000多岛民武装，防守方一共六七千人。围攻进行了四个月之后，虽然守军已经精疲力竭，所剩无几，但是奥斯曼大军也已经伤亡过半，传染病蔓延全军。这时候欧洲援军登陆马耳他，奥斯曼帝国只好撤军。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  要拿下一座城堡：需要巨大的政治优势，物质储备，并且要准备复出高昂的代价。而失败则意味着两败俱伤，而且攻城一方的成本是守城一方的很多倍。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  不管对于什么大国的君主，要动用四万全副武装的大军，去围攻一个城邦一年半载，都是倾国之力的重大行动。这种行动，很容易造成政情的波动和不可预见的风险。这种行动不可能经常进行。一般，强占一座城池，在经济上总是会吃亏。除非有特别强的政治意义。轻易不会硬来。英国的红白玫瑰战争中，红白两军经常绕行敌对城堡外围，很少敢强攻城堡。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  一个城堡的精髓，显然不是要人来打；相反，它的存在就是不要人来打，所以他必须足够吓人，显得足够坚固。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  今天的建筑上，经常采取外观看起来像石材的涂料来粉刷外墙，以显得更加昂贵。这种工艺可以说是彻头彻尾的传统工艺，因为，1000年前，英格兰的骑士就是把粉刷涂在木头城堡的外面，伪装成石头城堡的样子。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  如果你是一个领主，你要做的，就是要让大家都知道，要硬拿下你的城堡，是稳赔不赚的买卖。如果你的领地每年产生的利润是1万块钱。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  按照投资市场的估值，那么你的估值可能是15万。你要确保的就是你的对手拿下你的城堡要花费的代价超过15万。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  比如你可以告诉你的对手：我告诉你，而我这块领地，一年最多收1万英镑的税收。而我五年不吃不喝，花了5万英镑来修这座城，你想攻下我，起码要花50万英镑。您老人家肯定是没有50万英镑的，如果你从英格兰银行借50万，银行一年会要你5万英镑的利息，您老人家是稳赔不赚的。而如果您和我和好，我每年可以送给您50只烟熏的天鹅做为贡品。所以您老还是考虑一下吧。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  所以，城堡表面上看，是一种战争的硬件，但是其实是一种和平的硬件，保护秩序的硬件。事实上，欧洲多数的城堡并没有被攻打过。而城堡密集的国家，像中世纪的法兰西，其国本是自下而上的的，如马基雅维利的论述，这种国家难以灭亡。即使其王族破灭，但是其国本存在于几千座乡间城堡之中，其国家秩序很容易从中恢复。反之，像波斯大流士，其国土之中缺乏军事上自立的城邦，只要皇帝倒下，其国家土崩瓦解，瞬间落入亚历山大之手。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  而建筑一个城堡，其成本固然不小，但是他是一种秩序资源。比起遭受滔天洪水似的战乱和帝国的压迫要经济实惠得多。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  怎样设计一个城堡，只需要尽量少的钱，让对手花费足够的代价，这就是筑城的艺术。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>我这期，介绍城堡的最基本形式。其中包含了城堡的基本原理。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这就是诺曼人在10世纪-11世纪，在法国和英国各地修的这种，简单明了的设计叫做——Motte
  and Bailey。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这是两个很怪的类似法文的词，中文里面缺乏对应的词，你可以叫他们“高堡加地堡”。但是，用大家更熟悉的日本的称呼似乎更加达意，叫做本丸和二之丸。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  假设你是一个男爵或者类似等级的地主，你可以在自己的地盘里，找一个尽量陡峭的小山包；如果实在找不到，你就自己用土堆一个，能堆多高对多高。这就是你的Motte，高堡或者本丸。你可以环形的挖周围一圈的土，往中间堆，这样，等于你一边堆土，一边挖了一圈壕沟。坡边缘要直上直下，让人徒手爬不上来。
  土坡的顶上再修一圈围墙。围墙里面是一个高高的塔楼。英文通城Keep，按照日本的称呼，你也可以叫它天守阁。从天守可以俯瞰几个公里甚至几十公里，最好在你的领地边界可见就能看到，标识着你的领域。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  天守阁的一层，一般是仓库，厨房和粮仓。也储存酒，万一没有新鲜水源的时候，能长期保存的能喝的东西，只有酒，在古代水是不能长期保存的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  所以说句题外话，酒庄就叫chateau,
  chateau是法语，等于因为的castel，castel就是城堡。所以城堡酿酒和存酒是它的基本功能。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  说回天守阁，天守阁的二楼是主人和家人的房间。你看到的任何一个欧洲古堡，主人都是在二层。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>顶层阁楼，住着服务人员和哨兵。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  有时候，不止三层，可以盖四五层，可以有地窖，有金库，可以有监狱，这种监狱一般关押重要的犯人。玫瑰战争中，对方的国王，比如亨利六世，都是关押在伦敦塔里。伦敦塔里面最高的部分叫白塔white
  tower，就是一个Keep或者叫天守阁。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Motte或者本丸的面积经常很小。有时候只有几百个平米，有时候有几千平米。除非你是幕府将军、或者大明皇帝，老婆特别多。那么本丸里面就需要有几万平米的大奥，来储存后宫佳丽。但是小土豪的本丸都是不大的，天守阁就更小。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  为了装下其他的功能，还要修一个很大的院子，在高堡或者本丸的下面。这个院子，只比平地稍微高一点。有自己的围墙和壕沟，围墙上有自己的箭塔。他就叫做Beiley，低堡或者二之丸。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  二之丸和本丸之间，也隔着壕沟，要过一段桥，要通过一段很陡的楼梯，上到本丸。这是去本丸唯一一条路。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  二之丸里面，一般有一个水井——这是最重要的；每一个城堡，都需要有独立的水源，需要不受外界敌人的影响和破坏。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  城堡，就算在山上，也一般都是小山，基本没有人在特别高的山上。这主要就是水井的问题。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>二之丸里，还有一个铁匠铺，制造兵器，更经常的是修理打坏了的兵器。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>有一个马厩，一般一个小城堡都有几个骑兵。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>一个大厅：他既是法院，也是会议室，也是宴会厅</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>一个礼拜堂：进行思想政治工作。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>若干士兵宿舍。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>有时候有市场。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>低堡，Beiley或者二之丸，是一个东西的三种称呼。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>二之丸比本丸的直径大，地势不高。更容易被敌人攻破。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  但是敌人攻破二之丸，用处是不大的。守城的人可以都扯到本丸。靠喝里面储存的酒，还能坚持几个月。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>二之丸里能破坏的都是粗苯的东西。没有金银财宝、重要人物或者政治犯。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  而且，二之丸整个都曝露在本丸的射程之内。本丸的人居高临下，打下面的人有巨大的优势。所以进攻一方就是攻进二之丸，也保不住。很可能被守军居高临下打退。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>你要想结束战斗，还是要有本事打破本丸，冲进天守阁。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Motte，天守阁和本丸——面积只占整个城堡2分，只需要很少的几个人就能防守，但是射程是10分。防御力是10分，射程10分，需要花费整个城堡一半以上的成本。可以用一支最忠诚的小部队防守。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Bailey，二之丸的——占城堡面积的8成，但是也只是总花费的一半。他的防御力要弱一些，但是足以防守住90%的最常见的暴民草寇。当敌人特别强大的时候，二之丸是可以放弃的，不会导致满盘皆输。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Motte and Bailey的模式有各种变形。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这种结构还可以扩展和升级，二之丸不够，可以层层扩大，外面套上三之丸，四之丸、五之丸、西之丸，北之丸，给敌人设置重重关卡，形成蜗牛状的结构。壕沟可以一圈变两圈。围墙可以一层变两层，两层变三层。不过外面的墙必须必里面的矮。越里面的防守越坚固昂贵。用80%的成本去对付20%最凶恶的敌人，20%的成本去覆盖80%的功能。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  为了保护依附于贵族的工商业者，最外一圈城墙。会把市民的街区包围进来。因为在城里是最低的部分，所以叫下城。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1）成本逻辑：</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  你花1块钱，可以得到一个防御成功概率50%的关卡；但是你再花1块钱，不会的到成功率100%的，可能也就是70%。你花到3块钱的时候，得到成功率80%的关卡。边际效益是递减的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这样，不如你同样花3块钱，做3道防御成功概率50%的关卡，这样，敌人突破所有关卡的成功率，就是50%的三次方，12.5%。等于你所有防御的总体成功率有87.5%。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>这就是为什么高级的城堡都是一层层的关卡和陷阱。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>而像明朝县城那种一层皮的简单城池，主要也就是对付草寇和老百姓。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  理论上你可以把整个城池都搞的像天守阁一样高大坚固，但是那就太贵了。而且你的钱再多也是有限的，花同样的钱，这样必然不是防守面积最大的方案。而如果你全都按照二之丸的标准，防御能力又太松垮。你的全部投资换来的安全阈值太低。所以你必然是要有重点的投入你的资金。干房地产也是如此，小区的大门内外，人经常经过的地方，可以用一些昂贵而精致的造景。但是园区其他地方可以用一些朴素的草坪和花木。建筑的一层二层的外墙，人可以近距离观看的部分，要用最昂贵的材料；但是高层的部分，可以用一些节省的材料，只要远看可以就行了。这就是成本分配的一般原则。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  2）客户视角：城堡的客户，就是入侵者。这里面小贼是很多很常见的，城堡的整体在小贼造反面前要稳如泰山；灭国的大敌很少，大敌当前的时候，吃些小亏难免，但是能保住自己的核心基本盘。如果你想在大敌面前一点亏都不吃，那种成本其实是无法承受的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  3）忠诚结构：你的团队也是一样，对你最忠诚的，可以为邦国而死的核心，是不多的，所以最后的阵地，也不要指望很多人来给你坚守。你需要一支最忠诚最精干的小队能防御的小而强悍的据点。而大部分的不太重要的设施，只能由比较外围的追随者看守。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  4）不可逆结构：所有有三层城墙的城池，都是内墙比外墙高。城墙对外的一面各种防护非常发达，而朝里的方向基本完全裸露。敌人占领了外墙，但是要进入内墙之前，反而要越过死亡陷阱。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>城堡有大有小，但是是这样一种分层次的结构，是历史上最成熟的模式。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  我经常讲罗马的帕拉丁山和卡比多山。卡比多山，小而高；帕拉丁山，大而低。两者隔着一条水沟相邻。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这不就是Motte and
  Bailey的构造吗？卡比多山，显然是罗马的高堡。实际上罗马城很少被攻打。公元前唯一一次失陷，是公元前390年，被高卢军占领了城市的大部分。当时罗马的年轻士兵撤退到了卡比多山狭小的山顶，在上面坚守了7个月。高卢人最终撤退前也没有拿下这个高堡。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
