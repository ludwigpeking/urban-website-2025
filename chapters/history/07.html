  1) The natural unit for people to participate in the struggle for survival is
  not the individual, but their <strong>band</strong> of kinship. It can be
  extended to all identifiable relatives by blood. Its typical size is thirty to
  fifty people.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  2) These families have their ups and downs, and one of the elements is the
  ancestral grave. bands with a common ancestral graves are easier to form
  identification with each other. A union of multiple bands is formed through
  the institution of shrine dedicated to common ancestry, that is,<strong>
    a tribe</strong
  >.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  3) In addition to common shrine, other religious beliefs can also form a
  larger community of people. These larger communities, alliances of tribes, or
  <strong>city states</strong>, gradually became the main entities of the
  competition in human society. Therefore, places of worship are the initial
  hardware for the formation of cities. Cities are formed to organize people.

  4) <strong>A sanctuary's function</strong> is more than religion itself.
  Generally, a temple often serves the functions of,

<ul>
  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>1 can easily be used as a warehouse and a treasury;</li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>2 As a bank, grant relief or profit-making loans;</li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    3 The crowds gathered in the temple make the front of the temple the best
    location for a marketplace. Since ancient times, the temple and the market
    have been linked together—the so-called temple fair;
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    4 A temple, because it contains important property and holy relics, is also
    often a fortified stronghold, and it is a refuge for the followers in times
    of war;
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    5 The priests of the temple are also the earliest writers, astronomers and
    mathematians, so the temple is often a research and educational institution
    for writing, astronomy and mathematics;
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    6 The knowledge of astronomy and mathematics of the priestly class made them
    the earliest experts in irrigation and experts in dividing and measuring
    farmland.
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    7 Priests can conduct judicial decisions through fortune-telling or
    theological interpretation. So the temple is often a kind of court.
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>8 A decision-making body for war and policy.</li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In short, sanctuary has great significance for the development of society.
  Having mature and multifunctional religious sites is an important symbol that
  distinguishes cities from villages. Religious places, in order to strengthen
  their authority, erect monumental buildings and objects.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  5) The development of religious holy places is one aspect, and the other
  aspect, <strong>the agricultural revolution</strong>, is also very important,
  which is the invention of agriculture and animal husbandry. Among them, the
  agricultural way of life can support a particularly large population density,
  a part of which can be separated from food production, specialize themselves
  in religious activities or the construction of monuments. The construction of
  monuments was a major mode of competition among the different tribes and
  city-states. Therefore, the agricultural revolution and the vast farmland are
  also the basis for the rise of urban civilization.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  6) Farmers who enter the agricultural lifestyle often produce sizable
  production surplus. Their way of survival is relatively stable and does not
  participate in fierce competition. In a world of Bronze Age or Iron Age, with
  escalating violence in wars, the political power of most of the farmers was
  left behind. Farmers turned into peasants in the society was equivalent to the
  most downstream producer in the food chain, falling into the role of pure
  resource contributor. As a result, warriors, often hunters and herdsmen,
  appeared, forming a division of labor with the agricultural population and
  becoming the protectors of the peasants. The warriors and heros, are the
  origin of the king. They are both protectors and oppressors of the peasants.
  However, this symbiotic relationship between the two forms
  <strong>a symbiont</strong> that constitutes a complete biome at the dawn of
  the city.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Evolution is done under the pressure of competition. Under such pressure, one
  loses his/her "natural status', is forced to be integrated into a more complex
  organization and order, into the operation of the community machine, heavy
  agricultural labor and organized violence against one's own kind, to oppress
  and be oppressed. These actions made the city what it is,
  <strong>a new species of multicellular organism</strong>, or one may say, a
  physical container of complex orders.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Analog can be made that the ruler is like the nervous system of the human
  body. The brain lives in the meninges and is isolated from the blood to
  prevent the invasion of daily bacteria and viruses. In this way, brain cells
  can live a long life, which is equal to the human life span. Similarly, the
  rulers live in the Citadel, the central castle of a city, separated from the
  common people by tall walls. The fall of the Citadel of the city means the
  brain death of a city state, loss of functionality, and the demise of the
  city-state.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Therefore, the defense of a city is usually a Russian nesting doll-like
  structure, layer after layers. The more in the middle, the higher it is, the
  more difficult it is to conquer. Fighting from the outside, the invaders have
  to jump over layers of death traps. But hitting from the inside out is
  straight forward. Therefore, the outermost circle of the city wall, normally
  of the downtown, is not only a city to protect the commoners, but also a
  concentration camp for the commoners, a security util.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  7) In some cases, the roles of<strong> king and priest</strong> were
  intertwined, particularly when religious practices were relatively simple and
  did not require high levels of professional expertise. However, in more
  complex religious systems, the roles of kings and priests, those who
  maintained both political and religious order, often became distinct
  professions. It was common for kings and priests to depend on each other while
  also engaging in power struggles. In reality, they needed to take turns
  playing leading roles in different situations, forming a collaborative
  relationship. City-states with better coordination exhibited richer
  organizational patterns, while those that achieved lower-cost or more
  effective ways to maintain order had a greater chance of survival.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  8) Whether theocracy or kingship held dominant positions were
  <strong>manifested</strong> <strong>in the city</strong> as the inner city,
  the acropolis, or the citadel. What are in the citadel? Typically, it housed
  the royal palace, temple, and granary simultaneously. In some cases, the high
  priest also assumed responsibilities in warfare and jurisdiction.
  Occasionally, the king also served as a priest. In republics, there were only
  priests without kings, the temple often occupies the primary location in the
  citadel. Whereas for some European princes, who served the distant Catholic
  Church in Rome, often had castle that primarily taken by the royal palace,
  with the chapel in a secondary position.
</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In this series so far, still many important patterns have not appeared. In my
  next chapters, I will talk about the role of trade and natural resources in
  urban evolution. Of course, their importance in the formation of order is not
  less than that of religions and forces.

  小结一下，之前的几期。<br />1）人参加生存竞争的天然的单元，不是个人，而是他们的血缘共同体。也就是一个家庭。可以扩大到所有血缘上可以识别的亲族。典型的规模是三五十人。Band
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  2）这些家族有兴有衰，其中要素之一，是祖坟。有祖坟的家族分化出的多个家族，彼此之间容易形成认同。构成多个家族的联合，也就是部落。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  3）除了祖先、其他的宗教信仰，也可以构成人群的更大共同体的形成。这些比较大的共同体，家庭和部落之间的联盟，逐渐成为人类社会竞争的主要单元。因此，宗教圣地，是城市形成的最初硬件。城市是为把人组织起来而形成的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>4）一个宗教圣地，它的功能超过宗教本身。一般一个庙宇，經常充當的功能，</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1很容易做为仓库和金库；</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2做为银行，发放救济或者盈利性质的贷款；</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  3神庙聚集的人群，使得神庙的门前是最好的进行交换的市场，自古至今，庙和市场是联系在一起的——所谓庙会；
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  4一个庙宇，由于这里面有重要的财产和圣物，也经常是有防御的堡垒据点，在发生战乱的时候，是附属人民的避难所；
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  5神庙的专业宗教人士，也是最早的天文和数学专家，所以神庙也是天文和数学的研究所和学校；
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>6祭司阶级的天文和数学知识，使他们成为最早的水利专家和分割测量农田的专家。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>7祭司可以通过算命或者进行神学解读，来进行司法裁判。所以神廟是一種法院。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  8或者确定政策。未戰而廟算勝者，得算多也。是一個決策機構。总之，圣地，对于社会的发展有巨大的意义。拥有成熟的、多功能的宗教圣地是城市有别于村庄的重要标志。宗教圣地，为了强化其权威，会修建纪念碑或者纪念性的建筑，在英文里都叫momuments。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  5）宗教圣地的发展是一个方面，另一个方面，农业革命，也是非常重要的。农业革命，也就是农业和畜牧业的发明。其中，农业的生活方式，能够供养的人口密度特别大。使得大量人口的聚集成为可能。一部分人可以脱离粮食生产。专门进行宗教活动或者宗教纪念碑的建设。修建纪念碑，是古人不同氏族和城邦之间竞争的一个主要模式。因此农业革命和广阔的农田，也是城市文明兴起的基础。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  6）进入农业生活方式的专业农民，往往产出很多生产剩余。他们的生存方式是相对稳定，不参与到激烈竞争的。在青铜时代、铁器时代、战争暴力不断升级的世界上，农人政治权力旁落。相当于食物链中最下游的生产者，陷入纯粹的资源贡献者的角色。于是出现了经常是猎人和牧人出身的武士，与农业人口形成了一种分工，成为农人的保护人。武士、英雄，是国王的起源。他们既是农人的保护者、又是农人的压迫者。但是，两者之间的这种共生关系形成的共生体，构成了一个完整的生物群落。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  演化是在竞争的压力下完成的。在这种压力下，人脱离了天真。被迫形成更加复杂的组织和秩序。进入共同体机器的运作。繁重的农业劳动和对同类进行的有组织暴力，压迫和被压迫。这些行为构筑了城市。城市就是秩序的硬件。统治者，就好像人体的神经系统一样。大脑生活在脑膜里，和血液隔离，以防止日常细菌和病毒的入侵，这样，脑细胞才能长命百岁，和人的寿命相等。统治者生活在一个城市的核心城堡Citadel里面，和百姓之间，有高大的城墙相隔绝。Citadel的陷落意味着脑死亡，和全身机能的丧失。城邦的灭亡。所以城市的防守，通常是一个俄罗斯套娃一样的结构，一层层。越是中间，越是在高处，约难以攻克。从外面往里打，要越过一层层的死亡陷阱。而从里往外打则是居高临下。所以最外面一圈城墙，下城，既是保护民众的城池，也可以看成是民众的集中营。是一种治安工具。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  7）国王和祭司，在有些情况下是一体的。那是在宗教业务不太复杂，对专业能力要求不太高的情况下。而比较复杂的宗教，则经常发生国王和祭司，武力的秩序维持者和思想的秩序维持者，这两个专业的分化。这就是常见的，国王和祭司之间相互依赖又相互斗争。其实，这两者，需要在不同的形势下，交替的发挥主导作用。形成一种协作。这种协作进行的较好的城邦，具有更丰富的组织层次。在维护秩序的时候，会有一种成本更低的、或者更有效的方式来发挥作用。就具有更强的生存能力。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  8）神权和王权，谁人占据主导地位，在城市上表现为中心城堡，或者叫本丸，citadel.
  里面是什么内容。一般，中心城堡里，王宫、神庙和粮仓都是同时存在的。只是有的时候，大祭司兼职国王。有的时候国王兼任祭司。而共和国则只有祭司而无国王，只有一些军事集团领袖在充当国王的地位。而欧洲诸侯都遥奉远在罗马的天主教会，所以他们的城堡里，一般只有王宫，礼拜堂则处于从属地位。我的这个系列，到这里，还有很多很重要的东西没有登场。我下一个章节，讲一下贸易和自然资源对城市演化的作用，他们在秩序形成中的重要性当然不次于宗教和武力的。
