<p>As mentioned in Chapter 2:</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  A long-standing holy place needs to meet the following conditions: first,
  there should be no mudslides or landslides, which will make the tombstones
  disappear; second, there should be no floods accumulating silt or covering the
  original marks. Not to say that all ancient people knew how to choose such an
  location, I just visited the burial sites of the Hallstatt culture in Austria,
  which was covered by landslides for a few millennia before its recent
  rediscovery, signifying a quite common result.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  But, if one has the luck or knowledge to choose the right place, his tool of a
  united front will be there, his band may become a nation, otherwise the tool
  will be lost. This is a screening process in evolution.

<p><strong>Sanctuary Became Settlement</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  You can find that sites with good sanctuary conditions may also be suitable
  for settlements if they have a steady supply of water and food.
</p>

<p>Every locational choice of city has advantages and disadvantages.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  You may treat the city as an evolving subject. Competition and cooperation
  between cities carry on in many ways. One of the fundamentals is that city
  always needs <strong>grain and fresh water</strong>.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The distribution of cities, in most cases (we exclude a few cases, which of
  course have very strong observational value), in most cases,
  <strong
    >the distribution of cities and the distribution of cultivated land</strong
  >
  are roughly the same. Moreover, it is consistent with the distribution of
  irrigated land. There needs to be a large surplus of food in order for the
  population to gather in the cities.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The formation of irrigated land requires technology, such as drainage, the
  technology of draining the water from swamps to form cultivated land, and
  water diversion irrigation technology. Irrigation requires the ability to
  divert water firstly, and secondly, to distribute water fairly. All the people
  participating in the project should get water as equally as possible, so as
  not to cause conflicts. Another example is that after the regular flood in the
  Nile Valley, the marks on the land were washed away, requiring a new
  organizational technique for cutting and allocating the land. These knowledges
  were often developed and kept <strong>by the priesthood</strong>.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The development process of plains is characterized by gradual change, and it
  is worth noting that some areas that appear as plains today were once
  predominantly swamps or wetlands in ancient times. A striking example of this
  transformation can be observed in the lower reaches of the Yellow River,
  spanning from Jinan to the north, extending southward to the region below
  Tianjin, including the Xiongan New District. This vast expanse of land was
  previously a sprawling wetland prior to the Warring States Period, with no
  recorded cities or notable settlements. As the water level gradually receded
  from the late Warring States period to the Han Dynasty, the area underwent
  development, <strong>the recession of the wetland</strong> eventually giving
  rise to the establishment of Bohai County and Pingyuan County
  (渤海郡和平原郡). Consequently, the population density in this region began to
  increase.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The emergence of prominent cities such as Cangzhou, Dezhou, and Tianjin can be
  attributed to the flourishing Yuan and Ming canal shipping industry.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Among the most significant plains are the middle and lower reaches of the
  Yellow River Plain, the Mesopotamia Plain, the Nile Valley, and the Indus and
  Ganges River Plains. These expansive plains boast the longest history of
  agricultural development and encompass the largest areas. It is on such
  fertile irrigated lands and vast plains that the ancient world's four major
  agricultural civilizations and urban conglomerations thrived.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  (figure above: use the Po Valley as an example, most of the larger cities
  avoid the bottom of the valley and lie near the mountain base, particularly
  where a branch stream enters the valley. Mantua lies on a small mount in the
  middle of the valley. Ferrara, Venice and Ravenna seem to be the exceptions,
  whose ecomony were more dependent on the waters of the Po Delta. )
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Larger and Smaller Plains and Valleys</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Naturally, beyond these prominent plains, there are numerous other vast and
  smaller-scale plains that have also facilitated the growth of notable cities.
  For instance, the Ganges River Delta, the Yangtze River and the Pearl River
  Delta, several plains in Java Island, the Po River Plain, and the plains in
  southern Russia and Ukraine, to name a few. While it is impractical to list
  them all, these regions have contributed to the establishment of significant
  urban centers.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Relatively large valleys are sufficient for the presence of a single or
  multiple cities. A notable example is Mexico City, situated in a fertile
  valley that benefited from abundant irrigation and ample sunlight due to its
  low latitude. Utilizing Stone Age technologies, the indigenous managed to form
  a large city of 200,000 to 300,000 people even before the colonial era/
  without metal tools. Similar patterns can be observed in other regions, such
  as Taiyuan, the largest city in Shanxi, and various cities located in the vast
  Fen River valley, as well as Jincheng and Changzhi situated in the Shangdang
  Valley, and Datong positioned in the Sanggan River Valley. Smaller cities,
  too, can be found in smaller valleys.
</p>

  Japan has three largers plains. The first and most notable is the Kanto Plain,
  which encompasses Tokyo, the bustling capital city. The second is the plain
  area that encompasses Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe, which holds great historical and
  cultural significance. Lastly, we have the Nobi Plain, where Nagoya is
  located, serving as a vital economic hub. It is worth mentioning the potential
  fourth significant plain, the Ishikari Plain, where Sapporo, a major city, is
  situated.

  Among the five Central Asian countries, Kazakhstan stands as the largest,
  covering a vast expanse of 2.7 million square kilometers with a population of
  16.71 million. Uzbekistan, although smaller with an area of 450,000 square
  kilometers, which is about one-sixth the size of Kazakhstan, boasts a
  population of 19.9 million. This is primarily due to the presence of extensive
  plain agricultural areas in the Amu Darya and Syr Darya valleys, which have
  historically supported the dense concentration of ancient city-states like
  Samarkand, Bukhara, Tashkent, and Khwarazm.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In Yunnan, China, the Hengduan Mountains bear resemblance in size and
  elevation to the Valley of Mexico. However, due to the narrowness of the
  valley and limited arable land, it has not been able to develop a city of
  similarly large population.

<p><strong>On the Edge</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The size of city-states is closely linked to the amount of cultivated land
  they can control in their surroundings. Every plain with hundreds of square
  kilometers of arable land becomes a significant site for the establishment of
  an important city. However, it is <strong>NOT</strong> necessary for these
  cities to be located <strong>in the middle of the plain</strong>. Typically,
  they are situated near rivers traversing the plain, close to mountain base,
  and relatively upstream.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The availability of water is a crucial factor, and the
  <strong>degradation </strong>of water sources can lead to a decline in the
  quality of cultivated land. This phenomenon is particularly evident in certain
  valleys. A prime example is the ancient city of Angkor, where declining water
  levels and the subsequent loss of irrigation resulted in the decline of this
  once thriving civilization.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Grain Imports </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  There are, of course, exceptions to the rule. Some large cities have limited
  arable land in their immediate vicinity, yet their size surpasses that of the
  surrounding cultivated areas. Ancient metropolises like Syracuse, Athens,
  Rome, and Venice fall into this category. These cities heavily relied on
  sea-borne transportation for importing food from distant regions. Neither did
  the cities such as Kaifeng and Beijing in ancient times depend on local food
  production but rather relied on the canal transportated food from the regions
  on the Yangtze River.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In the modern world, it has become a common phenomenon for large cities to
  detach themselves from dependence on surrounding areas for food production and
  instead rely heavily on distant food imports. However, this trend is
  relatively recent and does not have a long history.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  As an exception, we exclude the plains in the southern United States or the
  plains of the Congo River in Africa, which are larger but later developed.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Fresh Water</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In addition to food, water is indispensable and needs to be solved nearby.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The foundation of Jerusalem's existence is its constant water supply, Gihon
  Spring, or Our Lady's Spring. Since the Stone Age, it has been the place where
  shepherds and merchants obtain water. In arid regions, water is the greatest
  strategic resource. It almost guarantees the development of a location.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Connection between Water and Market</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Judging from the current archaeological excavations, as early as the Bronze
  Age, there was a fortress guarding the spring. Those who guard this spring can
  charge a fee. It may not be in the form of collecting water fees, but by
  operating the <strong>market</strong> and collecting market fees. This spring
  is still there today, under the ancient city, the so-called City of David.
  Around this spring, there are very complex reservoirs and waterway works. This
  spring water system is famous because it is mentioned several times in the
  Bible. The stories are very rich. Legend has it that David conquered Jerusalem
  by adopting Shawshank's way of redemption.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Moreover, slipped in from a waterway mouth, and suddenly attacked from the
  inside. The captured Jerusalem.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The water resource of a city is, of course, a matter of life and death. Here
  are some <strong>common solutions</strong>.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  1) Venice collects rainwater and stores it in <strong>water cellars</strong>.
  Everyone went to the mouth of the water cellar to get water. However, the
  water collected in this way is relatively small and needs to be used
  sparingly.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Upstream Privilege</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  2) There is a river, and it is possible to draw water from the river. However,
  for relatively large cities, it is inevitable that the sewage will also be
  discharged into the river. In this way, the river water may be polluted. Take
  London as an example, The water from the upper reaches of West London is
  relatively clean; while the water flowing to East London is already very
  dirty, and people downstream drinking this water are at risk of intestinal
  diseases. And the water doesn't taste good either.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Of course, the improvement of sewer systems is crucial, preferably by
  bypassing the entire city and diverting them downstream. This technology has
  been well-established in ancient civilizations such as Mesopotamia, the Indus
  Valley, and the Roman era. However, urban technological advancements
  deteriorated on a large scale after the classical age, leading to the absence
  of sewer systems in many areas and times.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Consequently, a situation arises where wealthy individuals or nobles can
  afford to live upstream near clean water sources, while those who work in the
  city have to make do with ordinary water.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  For instance, in Beijing, we observe that the Emperor's Palace, the Old Summer
  Palace, and other noble residences are located in the Xiangshan to Haidian
  area, benefiting from first-hand mountain spring water.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Similarly, in London, Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace are situated
  upstream along the Thames River.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Vienna's imperial palace, Schönbrunn Palace, is also strategically located on
  the outskirts, where the mountain springs are transformed into picturesque
  waterfalls cascading down the hillsides.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Hence, some of the water features we see serve not only as decorative
  showcases but also as drinking water projects. In other words, drinking water
  projects are transformed into decorative and prestigious displays.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Massive Public Works for Water Supply</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In terms of drinking water engineering, the ancient Roman era demonstrated far
  greater maturity than the situations described above. They constructed water
  delivery channels, called aqueducts, spanning several kilometers or even
  dozens of kilometers from the surrounding mountains to directly supply
  mountain spring water to the city. These aqueducts typically took the form of
  viaducts, often consisting of multiple lines complementing each other to
  ensure a stable supply of drinking water. Remarkably, some of the ancient
  aqueducts in Rome remained functional until modern times.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Initially, witnessing these waterways was astonishing for me. However, it soon
  became apparent that such infrastructure was unearthed in numerous cities
  across Europe, and it was considered standard equipment of that era. Large and
  small cities, as well as military camps, were all equipped with these systems.
  Even a Roman military camp with fewer than 10,000 people, including the
  garrison and their families, had well-designed waterworks. This reflects the
  significant efforts the Romans invested in municipal engineering. Ordinary
  people would access water from public outlets, while the wealthy and public
  buildings, such as bathhouses, would receive direct water supply.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The ancient fountains in Italian cities, hundreds of thousands of years old,
  relied on natural gravity as they received water from the end of the
  waterways. Notably, these fountains were not powered by electricity ( in
  contrast to almost all modern chinese fountains.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Modern urban water supply schemes closely resemble those of ancient Rome,
  drawing clean mountain spring water from upstream sources. In fact, the area
  of the upstream water intake in a modern city is often several times larger
  than the city itself. This holds true for cities like Beijing and New York.
  Due to relatively low natural precipitation in temperate monsoon areas, a
  larger collection area is required.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Singapore, being a small city-state with a large population, experiences
  higher rainfall due to its equatorial location. Hence, its drinking water
  collection area can be smaller. Singapore has implemented specific engineering
  measures to protect these watersheds and prevent drinking water pollution. The
  city-state has created reservoirs by separating bays from the sea, bringing in
  fresh water and conducting environmental treatments in the surrounding areas
  to divert pollution sources and sewage systems. This constitutes a massive
  engineering feat.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Water Failures</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In the absence of aqueducts and with serious surface water pollution, reliance
  on groundwater through wells becomes necessary. Wells are a viable solution
  for small villages, but when it comes to large cities, challenges arise.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  If various forms of waste and wastewater produced by ancient cities cannot be
  effectively discharged downstream, the polluted surface waters gradually
  contaminate the groundwater. Over time, the groundwater becomes unfit for
  drinking.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  This is why the Sui Dynasty did not continue using the ancient city of
  Chang'an but opted to build a larger new city from scratch.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Beijing faced a similar situation, where most of the Yuan Dynasty did not
  continue using the old city from the Liao and Jin Dynasties. This was not due
  to a preference for the new over the old; rather, it was because the
  groundwater in these ancient cities was highly polluted.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, it is common to find ancient cities moving overtime.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the courts did not rely on well water but
  transported clear water from the Western Mountains using water trucks. This
  type of water supply was expensive and exclusive.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Silting</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Pi-Ramesses was a grand city constructed by Ramses II and was one of the
  largest and most opulent cities in ancient Egypt. It was originally thought
  the demise of Egyptian authority abroad during the Twentieth Dynasty of
  Egypt made the city less significant, leading to its abandonment as a royal
  residence. It is now known that the Pelusiac branch of the Nile began silting
  up c. 1060 BCE, leaving the city without water when the river eventually
  established a new course to the west now called the Tanitic branch, leading to
  the city's abandonment and subsequent deterioration.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Well/Fountain, the Square and the Market Place</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Wells and water outlets are essential public facilities and share similarities
  with temples. A small square is often found near the mouth of a well, serving
  as a natural gathering place for various communities in the city. In some
  cities, free markets even take place there. Sometimes, wells are located
  adjacent to or integrated with churches and temples. In Beijing, the small
  streets called Hutongs derive their name from the word "well." A street
  naturally forms a geographical community centered around the mouth of a well.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Monumental Fountains</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Now and then decorations are incorporated into beautiful fountains to showcase
  the city's wealth and promote the prestige of the benefactors.

<p>————————————————————————————————————</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>本系列第2讲提到过：</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  一個長久存在的聖地，它需要具備的條件：就是，第一，不要有泥石流和滑坡，這些會讓墓碑消失；第二，不要被洪水淹沒，洪水會堆積淤泥，覆蓋原有的地表記號。不是說所有的古人都懂得選擇這樣的地址，我剛剛在奧地利參觀哈爾施塔特文化的墓葬，那就是一個被山體滑坡覆蓋的地形。反正，選對了地方，你的統戰工具就在，沒選對地方，這個統戰工具就損失掉。這就是演化中的一個篩選過程。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  你可以發現，具有好的聖地條件的地點，如果有穩定的水和食物供應，也有可能適合建立定居點。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>每一个城市地址的选择，都有优点和缺点。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  你可以把城市当成一个演化的主体。它需要在很多方面很其他的城市竞争和合作。其中有一个基本面，就是，人总是要有吃有喝。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  城市的分布，多数情况，（我们排除少数的个案，那些个案当然有非常强的观察价值），多数情况，城市的分布和耕地的分布是大体一致的。而且，和水浇地的分布一致。需要有很大的粮食剩余，人口才能够在城市聚集。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  水浇地的形成，需要一些技术的支持，比如排涝，把平原沼泽的积水排走，形成耕地的技术。比如引水灌溉的技术。灌溉一是要能引水，二是要能公平的分配水。所有参加工程的人，应该尽量平均的得到水，这样才能不引发矛盾。再比如洪水后，土地上的边界记号被冲毁，需要重新切割和分配土地的组织技术。等等。平原的开发过程是缓慢的，一些现在看起来是平原的地方，在古代更接近于沼泽。比如黄河下游，从济南向北，到天津以南的这个区域，包括雄安新区在内，这片极其平坦的土地。在战国时代之前，就是一片沼泽。没有什么大城市，甚至没有什么记载的城邑。从战国后期到汉代为止，这里沼泽水位下降，得到了比较彻底的开发，有了渤海郡和平原郡。人口开始比较稠密。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>出现沧州、德州、天津这样的大城市，那是要到元、明运河航运业之后的事情。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  黄河中下游平原、两河流域平原、尼罗河谷地、印度河和恒河流域平原。这几个巨大的平原，是历史农业开发最悠久，面积最大的平原。所谓古代世界四大农耕文明，就是在这样的水浇地、大平原上形成的古代城市群。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>当然，除了这些平原之外，还有大大小小很多的平原。有些也产生了大城市。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  比如恒河三角洲、长江三间洲和珠江三角洲、爪哇岛的若干平原、波河平原、南俄乌克兰的平原等等，我们不一一列举。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  比较大的山谷里，也足以形成一个或者若干个城市。这就是墨西哥城所在的山谷，由于是肥沃的水浇地并且有低纬度的明媚阳光，在殖民时代以前，依靠印第安人的石器时代技术，就形成了二三十万人的大城市。你可以观察一下，山西境内的最大的城市太原和其他一些城市，在最大的汾河谷地里。晋城、长治在上党谷地里。大同在桑干河谷地里。其他的小一些的城市则在一些稍小的山谷之中。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  日本大的平原只有三个，一是东京所在的关东平原；二是京都大阪神户所在的平原区；三是名古屋所在的浓尾平原。或者也可以加上第四个，札幌所在的石狩平原。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>中亚五国中：哈萨克斯坦最大，270万km2,&nbsp;人口1671万</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  不兹别克斯坦，45万km2,相当于哈萨克斯坦的1/6，人口1990万。因为它有阿姆河和锡尔河流域的很多平原农业区。这里也是，撒马尔罕、布哈拉、塔什干、花腊子模这些古代城邦非常密集的地区。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  云南的横断山区，维度和海拔都和墨西哥谷地差不多，但是因为山谷太窄，耕地很少，就不足以形成城市。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>城邦规模的大小，与它们周围可以控制的耕地的大小直接相关。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  每一个有几百平方公里广阔耕地的平原，都会配备一个重要城市。但是它不一定是坐落在这个平原的正中。通常是在平原上河流经过的附近、临近山麓的、比较上游的地方。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  水是有变化的，水源退化，会导致耕地的退化的减少。这种情况在一些谷底比较明显。最明显的案例是吴哥古城，优于水位下降，耕地失去灌溉，导致这个古代文明的衰落。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  我们也会看到一些例外。一些周围没有什么耕地的大城市。它们的规模和周围的耕地规模不相称。像古代的大城市，叙拉古、雅典、罗马、威尼斯。它们一般和从水路运输的外来的粮食输入有关。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  开封、北京都这些古代大城市也不是靠本地的粮食生产，而是依靠运河从江南输入的粮食。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  当今世界的大城市，脱离周围区域的食物依赖，而基本完全依赖遥远的食物输入，已经成为普遍的现象。但是这种现象的出现并不是特别久。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这里面的例外，我们就排除了美国南方的大平原或者非洲刚果河大平原之类，更大但是开发较晚的平原。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>除了粮食，水源更是不可缺少的，需要在近处解决的。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  耶路撒冷，存在的重要基础就是它的一条泉水，叫做Gihon
  Spring，或者叫圣母泉。这里从石器时代，就是往来的牧人和商旅喝水的地方。在干旱的地区，水是最大的战略资源。基本可以保证一方的发达。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  从现在的考古发掘看，早在青铜时代，就有堡垒把守着这个泉水。守卫这个泉水的人，是可以收取费用的。可能不是以收水费的形式，而是靠经营市场，收取市场费。今天这个泉水还在，在古城，所谓大卫城的地下。围绕这个泉水，有非常复杂的水库和水道工程。这个泉水系统，之所以有名，是因为他被圣经提到过好几次。故事非常丰富。传说大卫征服耶路撒冷，就是采取了肖申克的救赎的方式，
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>而且，从一个水道口溜进去，从里面突然袭击。攻破的耶路撒冷。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>城市的水资源情况，当然是生死存亡的大事。下面讲一下常见的几种解决方案。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  1）
  威尼斯是靠收集雨水，存在水窖里。大家去水窖的口上取水。但是这样收集的水比较少，需要用得很节省。

  2）有一条河，从河里取水，是可以的。但是，对于比较大的城市，污水难免也排到河里。这样，河水是有可能被污染的。伦敦为例，西伦敦取上游的水，比较干净；而水流到东伦敦就已经很脏了，下游的人喝这种水，有得肠道疾病的危险。而且水的味道也不好。

  当然，下水道是可以改进的，最好是绕开整个城市，一直排到非常下游的地方。这种技术，在上古的两河流域、印度河流域的古城、在罗马古典时代的各个城市中，是非常成熟的。但是，古典时代之后，城市技术在很大范围内退化。很多的地区和和很多时代，是没有下水道系统的。

  所以，出现一个情况，就是有钱的人，或者贵族，那些不需要在城市里呆着的人。往往跑到水源地的上游去住。而需要在城里工作的人，则只能喝普通的水。

  在北京，我们知道，皇帝的行宫，圆明园等等，在香山到海淀一带。这里当然是第一手的山泉水。

  维也纳，郊外的皇宫则更加直接了当，就叫美泉宫。其主要的景观就是把山泉在山坡上做出瀑布跌水的样子。

  所以我们看到的一些水景，它们既是装饰品、炫耀品，也是饮用水工程；或者说是把饮用水工程做成装饰品、炫耀品。

  3）在饮用水工程的，古罗马时代的城市饮用水工程，比这些要成熟的多，他们从城市周围的山里，引几公里、甚至几十公里的输水道，直接把山泉引导城市里面。这种输水道一般是一个高架桥的形式。一般还不止一条。这样几条之间互相补充，可以形成更加稳定的饮用水供给。罗马城的古代输水道里面，有一条一直到近代还能使用。

  我在最早看到水道的时候，感觉非常惊叹。但是，很快你就发现，这种东西在欧洲很多城市都有出土，是那个时代的标配。大大小小的城市、军营全都配备。罗马的一个军营，一般驻军加上家属不到万人。但是上下水工程非常健全。可以看出罗马人在搞市政工程方面不厌其烦。一般百姓，到公共的出水口取水。而有钱人，或者浴室之类公共建筑，是把水直接通到户内。

  意大利城市里的喷泉，有几百几千年久，当然不是电动的。就是水道尽头的取水口。它们是靠自然重力供水的。

<p>
  现代城市供水方案，和古罗马的没有什么不同，也是从上游引洁净的山泉水。一个现代城市，它上游取水的区域面积，经常比城市本身的面积还大好几倍。对于北京和纽约都是如此。因为这种温带季风区的自然降水量比较小，需要的收集面积就更大。

  新加坡是非常小的城邦国，人口又很多，但是它在赤道地区，降雨大得多，所以它的饮用水收集面积会小一些。新加坡有专门的工程措施来保护这些流域，防止饮用水污染。储存巨量的饮用水的方法，是把从前市中心相邻的海湾和海隔开，再把淡水引进去。这样海湾就成为了淡水的水库。海湾的周边，也需要进行环境治理，把污染源和排污系统都改道引走。这个工程师巨大的。

  4）如果没有输水道，地表水又污染的比较厉害，那么就要靠地下水。也就是水井。这个解决方案适合小村庄。如果是大城市，它会遇到一个问题。

  古代大城市产生的各种排泄物和废水，如果不能有效的排到下游，那这些肮脏的地表水会逐渐污染地下水。天长日久，地下水将难以饮用。

  北京也是这样，元代的大都也不去沿用辽金的旧城，这不是因为他们喜新厌旧。而是因为这些古老的城市的地下水污染非常严重。

  皮·拉美西斯（Pi-Ramesses）是由拉美西斯二世建造的宏伟城市，是古埃及最大、最富丽堂皇的城市之一。最初认为，埃及在第二十王朝时期的国际影响力的衰落使这座城市变得不那么重要，导致其作为皇室住所的废弃。现在我们知道，尼罗河的佩卢斯支流在公元前约1060年开始淤积，当河流最终改道西边，即今天称为塔尼提支流时，这座城市失去了水源，从而导致了城市的废弃和后来的衰落。

  水井和水口，是一个重要的公共设施。和神庙有几分相似，水井口附近，经常是一个小广场，他们是城市里各个社区的天然公共场所，在有些城市有自由市场。有的时候，和教堂、寺庙直接相邻，或者结合在一起。北京管一个小街道叫做，胡同，就是从水井这个词来的。一个街道，一个天然形成的地理社区，它是以水井口为单元的。
