</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  We often perceive the mountains, rivers, and seas depicted on maps as ancient
  and unchanging, but this is hardly true.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Mountains are generally very old, with some dating back
  <strong>millions of years</strong>, most mountains have maintained a similar
  appearance over time, except for those with active volcanoes. When an active
  volcano erupts, it can deposit thousands of meters of volcanic material on
  flat ground, forming new mountainous structures. These eruptions can result in
  the creation of craters or bays with diameters of tens of kilometers. But
  volcanic eruptions are generally infrequent events, and their magnitude
  declines as the radioactive elements within the Earth become depleted over
  time. Landsliding takes place at only steep slopes and are normally limited in
  scale. In macro scope mountains can be almost seen as static for the span of
  human history.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The sea, influenced by ice ages, experiences fluctuations in sea levels over
  <strong>tens of thousands of years</strong>. As a result, coastlines undergo
  significant changes. For instance, the coast of the Bohai Sea was once located
  at the foot of the Taihang Mountains, submerging a large portion of the North
  China Plain. The Bohai Sea has even completely disappeared at certain points
  in history, leaving behind swamps. Over time, the coastline has receded to the
  periphery of the continental shelf, leading to the integration of the mainland
  and the Japanese archipelago. But it is not easily observed for the span of an
  individual life.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Rivers are far more dynamic and undergo rapid changes. For instance, the Han
  River, which was a major river in ancient times, experienced a diversion due
  to the 186 BC Wudu Earthquake. This diversion caused the upper reaches of the
  Han River to flow southward into the Jialing River. Consequently, today's Han
  River represents only the lower portion of the ancient Han River. Similarly,
  upper Rhine once drained into the Dnaub. The first capital for the State of
  Illinois, Kaskaskia, was on the eastern side of the Mississippi River, as
  Mississippi changed course following the flood in 1881, it is now on the
  western side. This happens <strong>in a person's life</strong> and creates
  many undesirable results.

  Rivers in plain areas exhibit even faster transformations. I previously
  addressed this topic in my podcast. This chapter delves into the relationship
  between hydrology and cities, offering additional materials and perspectives,
  albeit with some repeated information. In summary, the primary types of
  aquatic landforms can be classified as follows:
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol>
  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    <strong>Plateaus</strong>, such as Columbia Plateau and the Loess Plateau.
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    Small <strong>valleys</strong> within steep mountains, such as Yosemite and
    Zermatt Valleys.
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    Large river valleys,<strong> floodplains</strong>, deltas, and swamps. This
    category holds particular significance.
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    <strong>Lagoons</strong> formed by sand embankments resulting from seawater
    erosion, such as Venice Lagoon and Currituck Sound in Virginia.
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are expanded below:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  <strong>The first type is the plateau</strong>. Often ancient plains, plateaus
  were raised by tectonic movements. The elevation is not uniform, and there is
  a large difference in height between the high and low places.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In areas with large elevation differences, where the ground water velocity is
  relatively fast, the cutting effect of river water is dominant. On the high
  terraces, the surface soil will be washed away by the flow of water, and the
  riverbed will be washed deeper and deeper, forming gullies as if cut by knives
  and axes. In the deepest case, like the canyon of the Colorado River in the
  United States, it will be thousands of meters deep. In this process, the
  higher plateaus will be farther away from the river, and the water on the
  higher ground will become more and more scarce. Some originally fertile
  terraces lost irrigation after the river channel sank, and the soil became dry
  and barren.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  On the Loess Plateau, the hydrological conditions for agriculture used to be
  better than they are now. It is also the birthplace of the great powers in the
  East Asian continent in the past dynasties, and it is also likely to be the
  earliest settlement of the Chinese civilization. It is believed that both Xia
  and Zhou originated from the Loess Plateau. It gave birth to the most powerful
  state of Jin among the states of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty. Liu Han during the
  Five Hu period. The predecessor of the Sui and Tang Empires, the Northern Wei
  Dynasty. The predecessor of the Song Dynasty, in the Five Dynasties, there
  were four except the Late Liang.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In Shanxi, there are surprisingly many places that can become ancient
  capitals, such as Anyi, Quwo, Jiangcheng, Pingyang, Jinyang, and Pingcheng.
  From these cities great nations arose.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  I also mentioned before that the Angkor civilization is in the plateau area of
  Tonle Sap Lake. It is generally believed that the plateau area lost irrigation
  due to river erosion. Leading to the decline of Angkor.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Plateaus have acted as the cradle for numerous ancient civilizations.
  Presently, many fertile plateaus still exist, such as the Hetao area, the Fen
  River Valley, and the Mexico Basin.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>--</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  <strong>The second landscape</strong> emerges when water flows from the
  plateau into the plain with strong erosive force, creating
  <strong>steep valleys</strong>. Due to the narrowness of these river valleys,
  extensive arable land is scarce, limiting their capacity to support large
  populations and major cities. Nevertheless, these valleys often serve as vital
  commercial passages.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  As the river rushes out of the mountains, it enters
  <strong>the third landform - the flood plain</strong>. Notable examples of
  flood plains include the North China Plain, Jianghan Plain, Songnen Plain,
  Liaohe Plain, and Pearl River Delta.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The flood plain can be divided into three sections. The first section just
  lies where the river exits the valley and enters the Great Plains. The terrain
  in this area is normally slightly sloped, making it an ideal location for
  major cities to develop.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In previous discussions, (My Podcast) episode 44 covered Beijing, and episode
  3 mentioned Washington briefly. Episode 2 touched on London and Vienna as
  well. However, there are numerous other cities that fit this description. If
  you observe from north to south along the eastern foot of the Taihang
  Mountain, you will encounter a series of cities along the Beijing-Guangzhou
  Railway.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  For instance, there's Yanjing, present-day Beijing, a historically strategic
  location. Shijiazhuang, once known as Zhending, was another strategic site
  contested during the Anshi Rebellion and many other wars. Handan served as the
  capital of the Zhao State, and Linzhang in Hebei was the largest town
  developed by the Wei State. Yecheng served as a capital, and Anyang in Henan
  was the capital of the Yin and Shang Dynasties.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Similarly, if you follow the northern or southern foot of the Alps, you will
  come across a series of important cities, such as Vienna, Munich, Zurich,
  Turin, Milan, and Verona. These locations were not chosen by accident.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The Po Valley has displayed a similar setting. Most of the large cities are
  located at the mountain foot. Turino has the highest location, which is in the
  smaller upstream basin. Others are aligned on the north and south edges of the
  flood plain, with a few exceptions: Mantua, on a small mountain in the middle
  of the plain; <strong>Ferrar, Venice and Ravenna</strong>, which are more
  related to the <strong>lagoon </strong>economy. Ferrara's lagoon feature has
  disappeared for the modern landfills.
</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The common features among these places are as follows: 1) Proximity to rivers
  with access to water sources and transportation. 2) Positioned away from
  flood-prone areas downstream. 3) Presence of vast irrigated land, conducive to
  grain production. 4) Strategic locations at the intersection of valley
  commercial routes and foothill avenues, which was discussed in Podcast Episode
  #44. 5) Often featuring hills suitable for castle fortifications and leisure
  activities.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Upper Sites</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The large cities at the foot of the mountain can also be divided into two
  categories:
  <strong>the upper section and the lower section of the foothill</strong>.
  Modern large cities at the foot of the mountain are generally in the lower
  section. And older settlements will appear in a higher position upstream of
  today's big cities. You can find city sites from the Warring States Period at
  the Yamen Gate（衙门口） of Shijingshan in the upper reaches of Beijing.
  Mancheng （满城）in the upper reaches of Baoding（保定） is the site of an
  older city in Baoding. The ancient city of Zhongshan is in Pingshan County
  （平山县）upstream of Shijiazhuang. These ancient cities in the upper part of
  the foothills are characterized by more steep terrain, defensive location, and
  rivers flowing by. The valley flats will be relatively small, with arable land
  but not too much. This kind of terrain falls into the criteria of the terrain
  features required to build small reservoirs during the 1959 Great Leap Forward
  Movement in Communist China. By damming the mouths of the valleys, the rivers
  would flood these small high plains. Therefore, where there is a small
  reservoir today in China, the underwater area is likely to be a site of
  archaeological value.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Down into the Marshes</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  From the foothills road, into the center of the flatter and wider plain,
  whatever the terrain is today, in ancient times it was often represented by
  lakes, swamps or wetlands. Swamps and wetlands are areas of expansion of
  cultivated land. To develop these areas, it is necessary to master the
  techniques of drainage and irrigation.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Started from the mountainous plateau and the heights of the foothills, and
  then began to gradually develop the wetlands on the plains into farmland. is a
  common developmental trajectory.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Islands in the Wetlands</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Above the swamp, there are some higher hills or some small mounds exposed,
  like small islands in the sea. There are many such hills in the Yangtze River
  Basin, such as Guishan and Snake Mountain in Wuhan, Huqiu in Suzhou, and
  Jinshan in Zhenjiang.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In the Yellow River Basin, on the flood plain from Taihang Mountain to Mount
  Tai, the place name in ancient times was often called some hill（丘）. For
  example, Chuqiu（楚丘）, Diqiu（帝丘）, Fengqiu（封丘）, Shangqiu（商丘）,
  Taoqiu（陶丘）, and Kuiqiu（葵丘）. According to previous statistics, there
  were 53 place names with 丘 hill in the books, Chunqiu and Zuozhuan. Moreover,
  many of these hills are very important cities in history, including:
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    Chuqiu, which is recognized as the hill of ancestral temples by Chu people
    in Puyang, Henan today. It is also the cemetery of the ancient ancestors of
    this tribe.
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    Diqiu is the capital of the legendary Gaoyang Emperor Zhuanxu. In Qu Yuan's
    Lisao, he said that he was a descendant of Emperor Gaoyang. So Chuqiu and
    Diqiu seem to be talking about the same place, or different places that are
    very close to each other. Diqiu is a very important place in ancient
    mythology. But now it is a small village.
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    Taoqiu was the capital of Cao State in Spring and Autumn Period. It is also
    the place where Fan Li, as mentioned in the historical records, made his
    fortune in business under the pseudonym Tao Zhugong after he retired. It has
    been described as a major trade post. Obviously, in the Eastern Zhou
    Dynasty, there was a huge population and well-developed transportation
    around here. The surrounding river and lake network will be much more
    navigable than today, and water transportation was much more important than
    land transportation.
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Early Population Explosion</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Primitive agriculture, when combined with new irrigated land development,
  seemed to provide an endless supply of food. This abundance reflects the
  legendary "Garden of Eden" state, which mirrors the earliest human
  civilization's transition from the hills and smaller plains on the Euphrates
  River's right bank into the heartland of Mesopotamia. This represented a
  period of exponential growth, with resources expanding and population sharply
  increasing.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In archaeology, this stage is referred to as the Obeid period, which likely
  spans from 8,000 to 5,800 years ago. Villages of the Obeid period often lacked
  walls, indicative of a society where food was plentiful, and there seemed to
  be little reason for conflict.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Despite the richness of this period, only a few tales remain, among them the
  myth of a great flood, and the archaeological remains from the Obeid period
  buried under layers of sediment.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The flood plains of ancient times were both bountiful farmlands and death
  traps, traps that were both hydrological and social. Successive waves of
  civilizations, originating from the highlands, fell into these traps. The
  history of East Asia is a collection of stories where various forces attempted
  to develop agriculture on the plains, only to be eventually defeated.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Trap</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The mounds, often cited in the Zuo Zhuan of the Spring and Autumn Period, are
  difficult to locate today. These formations arose in a way similar to sand
  dunes in the desert. Sediment accumulated during floods, resulting in the
  mound protruding above the surrounding swamp, making it suitable for human
  settlement. However, after a few more cycles of flooding, it could be covered
  or flattened.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  These mounds in the alluvial plain's core area are transiently beautiful and
  might not feel risky at all within a few generations. They may become popular
  dwelling sites for a time, but in the long run, they are unstable and do not
  develop into lasting large cities.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>What if an ancient nation chose to enter the heart of the flood plain?</p>

    （Video above: most Chinese dynasties originated in smaller high valleys in
    the north west and gradually moving their centers to the grain aboundant
    plains in the southeast. This patterns repeats itself many times, with is
    not different from a similar pattern in the Indian Subcontinent.)

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The Warring States period of ancient China provides an apt historical context
  for the discussion. During this time, the State of Wei migrated from the
  rugged terrains of present-day Anyi in Shanxi Province to the Liang region
  around Kaifeng. "King Hui of Liang", one of the main characters in Mencius,
  refers to the title adopted by the king of Wei post-relocation.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Originating as a feudal duchy, Wei bore resemblance to the European feudal
  states where ordinary citizens were under the stewardship of nobles and
  dignitaries rather than being direct subjects of the Holy Roman Emperor.
  Traditionally, the citizens of Wei were under the command of the nobles and
  not directly under the king of Wei. However, upon relocating to the grand city
  of Daliang, the vast land surrounding it came under the direct jurisdiction of
  the king of Wei.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Another tale involves Ximen Bao's governance of Yecheng. Usually, the lands of
  Wei were managed by the nobles. However, Ximen Bao was not a noble of Wei, and
  Yecheng was not his fiefdom. He was a hydrology expert and a bureaucrat,
  personally appointed by the king of Wei, akin to the governor of Lima
  appointed by the king of Spain. He was in charge of managing the king's
  finances.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  By occupying the regions of Liang and Yecheng, the king of Wei amassed wealth
  surpassing that of all traditional nobles in Wei. He could then recruit
  warriors and migrants from all over, establishing one of the strongest
  absolutist states in the early Warring States period, initially experiencing a
  period of immense prosperity.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The process was similar to the migration of the State of Zhao from Jinyang in
  Shanxi to Handan in Hebei.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Yecheng and Liang, later known as Bianliang or Kaifeng, possessed expansive
  irrigable land and a convenient waterway network. They attracted numerous
  regimes from the western and northern regions beyond the Taihang Mountains. In
  addition to Wei, Yecheng hosted later regimes like Zhao, Ran Wei, Qian Yan,
  Eastern Wei, and Northern Qi, which all originated from the lands of Jin and
  Yan.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  After the construction of the canal in the Sui Dynasty, Bianliang became the
  most critical city in the North China Plain. The Bianhe River's water
  transportation could reach the Huaihe River directly, and then through the
  canal, it could reach Yangzhou and Suzhou, the most prosperous grain-producing
  areas. For hundreds of years after the Tang Dynasty, it was the principal city
  in Kanto and the most crucial military governor (Jiedushi). The regimes of the
  Five Dynasties, the Later Han, Later Zhou, and Northern Song, all originated
  from Jinyang and sought development and established their capital in
  Bianliang.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Other examples include the ancient kings of Upper Egypt establishing their
  capital at Memphis in Lower Egypt or Turkic Islamic pioneers developing the
  Bengal region.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  However, the hydrology of alluvial plains is incredibly unstable. As
  previously mentioned, the six cities under the ground of Kaifeng were
  periodically inundated and buried under layers of silt. The foundation of the
  lowest city of Kaifeng is buried several meters below today's city surface.
  Every flood left several meters of silt behind.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Between the Yellow River and the Hai River, and between the Bian River and the
  Si River, no river has a fixed course. Bian River's navigation was easily
  blocked by silt. In the Yuan Dynasty, a new canal, closer to Dadu, was built
  from Jining and Dezhou, bypassing Bianliang and causing a drastic drop in
  Bianliang's economic status. This is a characteristic of delta cities:
  population increases are rapid, but disasters are also dramatic, leading to
  abrupt rises and falls. This is a common trait among the four major river
  civilizations of ancient times.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Some cities, such as New York, Venice, Constantinople, Hong Kong, etc., which
  have less direct adjacency to flood plains and more to do with maritime
  activities, are not discussed above.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Three Types</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  To summarize, from a hydrological perspective, there are generally three types
  of locations chosen for major cities:
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  1) Cities on high ground often have ancient cities, but high ground often
  encounters the problem of soil degradation.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  2) Cities on the foothills of mountains, where the hydrological environment is
  most stable.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  3) Cities at the heart of alluvial plains, which, in ancient times, had
  astonishing population explosions and prosperity. However, they often
  encountered disasters due to floods and changes in river courses, typically
  based on a small hill or mound.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Among these three types, the second type is most likely to develop into major
  cities that transcend eras.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>我们经常认为自己在地图上看到的山川大海是非常古老的。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  山一般非常古老，倒退100万年，多数的山看起来都和现在差不多，但是活火山除外。活火山大爆发的时候，可能平地上堆起上千米的高山。可能几千米高的山被炸上天。有时候会产生直径几十公里的环形山或者海湾。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  海，随着冰期，海面有时高，有时低。在几万年的周期上，海岸的变化很大。渤海海岸曾经在太行山脚下，淹没华北平原大部分；渤海也曾经完全消失，只留下一些沼泽，海岸后退到大陆架外围，大陆和日本列岛连为一体。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  河流，变化最快。今天的汉水，古代是一条很大的河，但是，在西汉初年，发生武都大地震，汉水上游发生改道，向南流入嘉陵江。现在的汉水，只是古代汉水的下半段。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>平原地区的河，变化就更快。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  和这个有关的内容，我在第9期，曾经讲过。而且当时讲的科里奥利力的细节有错误。我这一期也是以水文和城市的关系为主要话题。会稍微有一点重复，但是会涉及其他的素材和角度。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>简单的说，最主流的水成地貌可以分成几种。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>一，高原，比如山西、陕西一带的黄土高原。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>二，是山地的陡峭的河谷；</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>三，是平原、大河谷、三角洲、沼泽发达的洪泛区；这个大类最主要。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>四，是海边靠海水冲刷形成的沙堤包围潟湖。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>我下面展开：</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  第一种，高原。高原，经常就是远古的平原，被地壳运动抬高。抬高并不是均匀的，高处和低处间形成很大的高差。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  高差大的区域，在水流速比较快的地方，河水切削的作用为主。高处的台地上，水流过会冲走地表土壤，的河床会越冲越深，形成刀砍斧劈的冲沟。最深的情况下，像美国的科罗拉多河的峡谷，会有上千米之深。在这个过程中，高处的台地会离河面原来越远，高地上变得越来越缺水。有些原本很肥沃的台地，在河道下沉之后，失去了灌溉，土壤变得干旱贫瘠。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  黄土高原，他的台地的水文条件曾经比现在好得多。他也是历朝历代东亚大陆强有力的大国的发源地，而且也很可能是华夏文明的最早的定居地。据认为夏商周都发源自黄土高原。孕育了东周列国里面最强大的晋国。五胡时期的刘汉。隋唐帝国的前身，北魏。宋的前身，五代中，除去后梁之外的四个。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  山西境内，能成为古都的地方，其实意外的多，安邑、曲沃、降城、平阳、晋阳、平城。从这些城邑，兴起了大国。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  我之前也提到过，吴哥文明，在洞里萨湖的高原地区。一般认为，河道冲刷导致的高原地区失去灌溉。导致了吴哥的衰败。
</p>

  高原是很多古文明的摇篮的摇篮。今天，仍然有很多肥沃的高原，比如河套地区、比如汾河河谷、再比如墨西哥盆地。

  水从高原进入平原的这一段，它的冲刷非常强烈，就形成陡峭的河谷。这就是第二种地貌。这种河谷，由于非常窄小，一般没有广阔的耕地，也就不能养育特别大量的人口。所以往往不能产生什么大城市，但是这种河谷可能是商贸的咽喉。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  河流冲出最后的山地，会进入第三种，也就是最后一种地貌，那就是冲积平原。比如华北平原、江汉平原、松嫩平原、辽河平原、珠江三角洲等等。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  平原也分为三段，第一段，是河流刚刚冲出山谷、进入大平原之前的山麓地带，地形较平，又微微隆起，这里是最重要的大城市的典型位置。

  我在第44期讨论过北京、第3期讨论过华盛顿。第2期简单提到过伦敦、维也纳。当然，这个类型不止如此。你沿着太行山东麓从北往南往下看，沿着京广铁路你会看到一串城市。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  燕京，也就是北京；石家庄，也就是古代的真定，安史之乱争夺的战略要地；邯郸，那是赵国的都城；河北临漳，那是魏国开拓的河北地区最大的重镇，北朝的都城邺城；河南安阳，那当然是殷商的都城。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  你沿着阿尔卑斯山的北麓或者南麓，也会看到一串重要城市，维也纳、慕尼黑、苏黎世；
  都灵、米兰、维罗纳。这些当然毫不偶然。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这些地方的共同特点，1）临近河流，有水源和水运。2）俯瞰着下游，远离水灾。3）周围有平坦广阔的水浇地和粮食产区。4）把守着河谷商业通道和山麓大道的交叉点，山麓大道，我在第44期应该已经讨论过。5）经常有可以休假城堡的山丘。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  山麓大城市，也可以分成山麓上段和山麓下段两类。近代的山麓大城市，一般在下段。而更古老的聚落，会出现在今天的大城市的上游更高的位置。你可以在北京上游的石景山衙门口挖掘出战国时代的城址。保定上游的满城是保定更古老的城址。中山国的古城在石家庄上游的平山县。这些山麓上段古城的特点是，地形更险峻，具有更强的防卫性，有河流流过。山谷平地会比较小，有耕地但是不太多。这种地形，和大跃进时期修建小水库需要的地形特征是非常相似的。在山谷的谷口堵上堤坝，河水就会淹没这些高处的小平原。所以，今天有小水库的地方，这水下面很可能是具有考古价值的地点。
</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  从山麓大道，进入更平坦广阔的平原中心，不管在今天是什么样的地形，在古代经常表现为大量和湖泊和沼泽、湿地。沼泽和湿地是耕地的扩张区。要开发这些地区，需要掌握排涝和灌溉的技术。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  从山地高原和山麓的高处发迹，然后开始逐步把平原上的湿地开拓成为农田。是一个常见的发展轨迹。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  沼泽上面，有一些高一点的小山或者还一些的小土丘露出来，好像海里的一个个小岛一样。长江流域这种小山较多，武汉的龟山、蛇山，苏州的虎丘、镇江金山，就是这类小山。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  黄河流域，从太行山到泰山之间的冲积平原上，上古时代的地名经常叫某丘。比如楚丘、帝丘、封丘、商丘、陶丘、葵丘，前人统计春秋和左传里面的带丘的地名一共出现过53个。而且这些丘中很多是历史上非常重要的城市，其中包括楚丘，在今天河南濮阳，它被楚人认定为宗庙之丘。也就是这个部落远古祖先的墓地。帝丘，是传说中高阳帝颛顼的都城。屈原的离骚中，说自己是高阳帝之苗裔。所以楚丘和帝丘好像说的是一个地方，或者是距离很近的不同地方。帝丘是古代神话中很重要的一个地方。但是现在是一个不大的村子。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  陶丘，是春秋曹国的都城。也是史记里说的范蠡退休之后，化名陶朱公经商发财的地方。它被描述成一个巨大的商业都市。很明显，在东周列国时代，这里的周边有庞大的人口和发达的交通。这周边河湖网络会比今天发达得多，水运会比陆运重要很多。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  原始农业一旦和开发出新的水浇地结合起来，随之而来的，是仿佛有无穷无尽的粮食可以吃。根据有些分析，传说中伊甸园那种富足的，无忧无虑的生存状态，反映的是最早的人类文明从幼发拉底河右岸的那些丘陵和小平原进入美索不达米亚的腹地的状态。这是一种典型的进入蓝海的爆发期，财力增强，人口猛增。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这个阶段，在考古上被称为欧倍德时期，大概对应于现在8000多年到5800年之前的这个时期。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  欧倍德时期的村庄，经常是没有墙的，他们好像过着一种有的是吃喝，连抢都懒得抢，你好我好大家好。四海一家，自我和他者毫无区别，非常符合白左价值观的世界。看起来很像是现代农业发达的吃喝不愁的现代社会。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  不过，这个时期，没有留下特别多的故事，我们所知道的只是一个大洪水的神话传说。然后是被掩埋在深深的泥地之下的欧倍德时期的考古遗址。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这当然不是美索不达米亚平原独有的。上古时代的冲积平原，既是富饶的农田，也是死亡陷阱。这种陷阱，是水文方面的，也是社会组方面的。我这期主要讲水文方面的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  人类一代一代，从高原而来，进入这个陷阱。东亚的历史，就是各种势力开发平原农业，然后遭到灭亡的系列故事。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  春秋左传里常常出现的那些丘，你今天已经很难发现踪迹了。因为他们本来形成的原理就好像沙漠里的沙丘一样，是洪水中，泥沙以一种复杂的流体力学过程堆积起来的。可能本来也之比周围高个几米。在其形成之初，突出于沼泽地的表面，方便人类定居。但是再经历几轮洪水，就可能覆盖或者抹平。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  所以冲积平原核心地带的这些丘，是一些短期看非常美，在几代人甚至十几代人之内可能完全感觉不到风险的。短期课可能盛极一时，但是长期看很不稳定，并没有积累成连续存在的大城市。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>如果一个古代国家选择进入冲积平原核心地带，会怎么样呢？</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  像战国时代的魏国，从江山险固的今天山西境内的安邑，迁到开封一代梁地。孟子里面的主角之一“梁惠王”，就是对迁都后的魏王的称呼。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  魏国起源于一个封建侯国，一般的百姓就像欧洲封建邦国的百姓一样，是属于公卿贵族的，而不直接属于神圣罗马皇帝。传统上，魏国的百姓从属于公卿，而不直接从属于魏王的。但是，迁到了大梁城，这周围巨大的国土，都是魏王的直属领地。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  另一个故事是西门豹治理邺城。通常，魏国的土地是贵族管理的。但是，西门豹不是魏国的贵族，邺地，也不是西门豹的封地。他是一个魏王个人委任的一个治水专家色彩能弄的官僚。类似于西班牙国王排除的利马总督。是负责给魏王理财的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  占据了梁地和邺地，导致魏王他一个人控制的财富远远超过了魏国所有的传统贵族之和，他可以招募天下的侠士、流民，建立起了战国早期最强的绝对主义国家。在最初盛极一时。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>也是赵国从山西境内的晋阳，迁移到河北境内邯郸一代的过程。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  邺城和梁地，也就是后来的汴梁或者开封。他们既有无比广阔的水浇地、也有方便的河道运输水网。它们吸引了很多政权从太行山以西以北而来，邺城，除了魏国。建立了后赵、冉魏、前燕、东魏、北齐，这些当然都是晋地燕地起源的政权；汴梁，不止是魏国，在隋朝修通了运河之后，汴梁就是华北平原最重要的城市，因为汴河水运可以直通淮河，然后经过那时候的运河可以到达扬州、苏州，那是最富饶的粮食产区。也是唐代之后几百年，关东最主要的城市。是最主要的节度使。五代的，后汉、后周、北宋，其政权都起源于晋阳，然后进入汴梁谋求发展，并且定都。
</p>

  或者古代上埃及的国王在下埃及的孟菲斯建立都城的过程。或者突厥伊斯兰教开拓者，开发孟加拉地区的过程。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>但是，冲积平原的水文是极其不稳定的。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  如我之前讲过，所谓开封城下有六座城，它周期性的遭到淹没，被淤泥覆盖。最下面的开封城的地基，在今天城市地面以下十几米的地方埋着。每次发生洪水都会留下几米深的淤泥。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>黄河和海河之间，汴水和泗水之间，没有一条河有固定的流向。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  汴水的航运也是容易被泥沙拥塞。在元代，新的运河，从济宁、德州一线，从更近的路线通向大都，绕过了汴梁。于是汴梁的经济地位一落千丈。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在埃及尼罗河三角洲，尼罗河有很多分叉，这些分叉是时东时西，非常不稳定的。古代在三角洲建立都城，一般都借重这些地点的水运之利，但是河道改道之后，原来河边的城市就变成内陆城市，遭到放弃。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这就是平原三角洲城市的一个特点，人口增加起来特别快，遇到灾变的时候也特别剧烈，乍起乍灭。这是古代四个大河文明的共通之处。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  还有一些和农业关系不大的城市，比如纽约、威尼斯、香港等等就不在上面讨论之列。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>我稍微总结一下：</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>从水文的角度，大城市的选址一般有三类：</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  1）是高地上城市，高地上经常有很古老的城市，但是高地经常出现的问题是耕地的退化；
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2）是山麓边缘的城市，这里水文最为稳定；</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  3）是冲积平原核心的城市，这些地段，在古代曾经爆发出惊人的人口和繁荣，但是经常优于洪水和河流改道的原因，遭遇灾变。一般以一个小山或者小丘为基础。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>上述三类城市中，最容积沉淀成为跨越时代的大城市的，是第二种。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>河心沙洲。(待补充）</p>
