  In Wuqiao, Hebei, there's a thriving tradition of producing acrobat troupes.
  Yet, performing only in their hometown isn't sustainable. Locals have become
  too accustomed to their acts. To captivate a broader audience and maximize
  earnings, they must venture out and tour other regions.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In ancient Americas, indigenous people crafted sharp blades from obsidian and
  flint. Flint Ridge in Ohio was a prominent source of flint, yet many other
  areas were devoid of it. Consequently, flint from this region was frequently
  traded and transported to various parts of the North American continent—even
  as far as the Rocky Mountains and the Gulf of Mexico, artifacts made from
  Ohio-sourced flint have been discovered.

  In 2003, if I encountered a German in Beijing, there was a high likelihood
  they were an architect. One might wonder, why were so many German architects
  in Beijing? It was because their skills and expertise were in greater demand
  and thus more valued in Beijing than in Germany, where there was already an
  abundance of architectural expertise.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Technology tends to disseminate from regions where it's prevalent to those
  where it's scarce. Various goods and skills follow a similar trend, spreading
  from places of abundance to those of shortage. This diffusion process
  generates immense benefits.
</p>

  Imagine a stone perched silently atop a mountain. If allowed to roll down, the
  descent releases a tremendous amount of energy. This energy, familiar to us,
  is known as potential energy. In English, "potential energy" refers to the
  power stored when static, only to be released during motion, much like how
  electricity flows from areas of high voltage to those of low voltage.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Likewise, technology and goods possess this inherent potential energy—a
  driving force propelling them towards diffusion and proliferation.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Theory of Resistance</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Propagation, like in electrical circuits, faces resistance. Consider the
  peaches from Shenzhou(a smaller city famouse for peachoid produce in North
  China): while there's demand in Shijiazhuang, 100 kilometers away, the 'peach
  potential' isn't realized easily. Traveling on foot with kilos of peaches for
  three days to sell them isn't efficient; the costs outweigh the profits.
  Essentially, the 'resistance' between these places is too high for trade. Only
  with faster transport methods, like mule carts, did this resistance diminish,
  enabling trade. Today, I present a concept: envisioning the world map as a
  circuit diagram.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Regions either have high or low potential. Technologies and goods, akin to
  electric currents, flow from high to low potential areas. This flow's
  resistance is influenced by transportation convenience and efficiency. In
  isolated regions, despite a potential difference, the flow is hindered.
  However, areas with seamless connectivity, despite their physical distance,
  experience strong flows due to low resistance. Over time, these regions
  equilibrate in terms of technology and goods availability. Let's delve into
  this grand flow visualization.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Era of Canoeing</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Human carrying capacity is limited when on foot. Before the advent of
  transportation, only extremely valuable items like flint, obsidian, salt, and
  gems were deemed worth transporting over long distances.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Thus, the earliest invention for substantial transportation was the dugout
  canoe, followed by simple sailboats. The oldest discovered canoe, unearthed in
  the Netherlands, dates back about 10,000 years. Primitive sailboats, seen as
  modifications of the canoe, date back 6,000 years from the Cucuteni-Trypillian
  culture in Ukraine and Romania.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Canoes were revolutionary. Carrying loads on foot over long distances is
  exhausting, but a person in a canoe could transport much larger loads and
  potentially travel faster. Essentially, the canoe reduced "resistance" on
  suitable routes by manyfold. Large sailboats took this further, reducing the
  resistance even more. They turned rivers like the Danube and Nile, and seas
  like the Mediterranean, Baltic, Red, and Arabian seas, into ancient
  'superhighways'.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Imagine ancient humans 10,000 years ago, setting off from Somalia in Africa,
  paddling along the coastline. They'd stop for food or freshwater, or shelter
  during bad weather. How long would it take them to reach the Pearl River
  Delta? Modern humans might take two years with the advantage of money and
  modern amenities. Our ancestors would've been slower. From a technological
  standpoint, five to ten years is feasible. They typically undertook shorter
  journeys due to lack of clear long-distance objectives.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The origin of rice remains a topic of debate. One day the oldest samples are
  found in the Mekong Delta, the next in the Yangtze Delta, followed by even
  older samples in the Pearl River Delta. These discoveries reflect the
  interconnected nature of ancient coastal trade. As a result, similar-aged
  samples are found in all these regions.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Coastal cities might appear distant from each other, spanning thousands of
  kilometers. Yet their trade relations might be tighter than between a coastal
  city and an inland city merely a few hundred kilometers away. The Liangzhu
  culture in Hangzhou has lineage traces to Austronesians (Pacific Islanders and
  Taiwanese). Linguistically, they're believed to be closer to Thai.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Trade Winds</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In the subtropics, monsoons, also known as trade winds, reverse direction
  cyclically every year, making annual cyclic voyages convenient.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Actually, 5,000 years ago, how long would it have taken to travel from the
  ancient city of Harrapa by the Indus River in present-day Pakistan to the
  ancient city of Ur in present-day Iraq? Estimated as at most two months.
  Moreover, it's possible to make a round trip within a year, riding with the
  trade winds, efficient and energy-saving. A significant portion of the
  technology in the ancient Indus Valley civilization has to do with the
  exchange with the Mesopotamian civilizations. The maritime spread of this
  technology to the Indus River, 2,000 kilometers away, facilitated the rise of
  the ancient Indus Valley civilization. Their trade connections are evident.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The Mediterranean region benefited greatly from the trade winds. 3,200 years
  ago, the ruins of Phoenician colonies spanned from present-day Lebanon to
  Portugal and Morocco, covering distances of four to five thousand kilometers.
  Yet, they all belonged to the same trade circle and had a comprehensive
  understanding of each other's existence. Ancient Greek city-states weren't
  confined to the Greek peninsula. Closer regions included all the islands in
  the Aegean Sea, Crete, cities on the western coast of Anatolia, Rhodes,
  Cyprus, Brindisi in southern Italy, Taranto, Naples, Syracuse on Sicily.
  Further locations extended to Crimea by the Black Sea in the east and
  Marseille in present-day France in the west, all under the umbrella of Greek
  culture.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  During this era, mainstream traded goods included artifacts, fur, amber,
  pearls, and other relatively expensive items. They also traded in bulk
  commodities like grain and olive oil, which made sense to transport via large
  ships. Notably, the tin ore, essential for making bronze tools, was a
  prominent trade item. Making bronze tools required both copper and tin ores.
  While copper ore was somewhat rare, tin ore was even rarer, affecting the
  manufacturing of weapons crucial for a nation's survival. In ancient times,
  tin ore often traveled thousands of kilometers, akin to today's uranium-235—a
  strategic material.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  On a serene Earth, one could perceive that the vast expanses of land were akin
  to areas with subtle currents. Yet, it was along coastlines and rivers where
  more dynamic currents took shape. These waterways, vital for navigation,
  breathed life into their surrounding regions, becoming hubs of activity. This
  vibrancy illuminated areas close to water, highlighting them as early cradles
  of civilization, even as large swathes of continental interiors remained
  relatively untouched and mysterious. Consider an Athenian merchant of the
  time: he might have been more acquainted with Rhodes, despite it being a
  considerable distance away, simply because a brief sea voyage would lead him
  there. Meanwhile, Mount Olympus, although closer and a daily sight, might have
  been less explored due to the daunting terrestrial journey it posed. An
  Egyptian familiar with the Nile, stretching a thousand kilometers up and down
  the river, might not like to venture into the desert just a few tens of
  kilometers from the riverbanks. This was the world in which early
  civilizations existed.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Age of Chariots</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In ancient times, the vast hinterlands were largely unexplored, with major
  civilizations mainly situated near seas or major rivers. This situation
  changed dramatically due to the introduction of the horse and the invention of
  the wheel.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The wheel's invention dates back around 5,000 to 6,000 years ago.
  Archaeological evidence of early wheels has been found almost simultaneously
  in regions like the Mesopotamian basin, the Caucasus, Ukraine, and Romania.
  This suggests that the technology spread rapidly.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Following the invention of the wheel, horses were domesticated. Before horses,
  oxen were used to pull carts. Horses then became a more versatile alternative
  for oxen in hauling carts. The earliest evidence of horse domestication traces
  back over 5,000 years ago in the vast Eurasian steppes, specifically in the
  region north of the Black Sea, present-day Ukraine.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Notably, the aforementioned regions are all closely knit, essentially
  encircling the Black Sea.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The true chariot had wheels with spokes, making it relatively lightweight. If
  one were to map out all the unearthed chariots globally, based on their
  historical timeframes, much like contour lines on a map, the highest point, or
  the earliest occurrence of spoked chariots, would be in Central Asia, in
  today's Russian Federation, near the northwestern region of Kazakhstan,
  specifically around the state of Zintashta-Petrovka.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  This area is recognized as the birthplace of chariots. From here, the ancient
  chariot technology spread throughout the world. Around 4,000 years ago,
  starting from this point, it took about 200 years for similar chariots to be
  found throughout Central Asia and the Eurasian steppes. Another 200 years
  later, they reached Mesopotamia, Central Europe, the Indus Valley, the
  Mongolian Plateau, the upper reaches of the Yellow River, and Egypt. By the
  time of King Wu Ding of the Shang Dynasty, 800 years had passed since the
  chariot's initial appearance. Western Europe, the Jianghuai region, and the
  Bengal Delta still had not seen the emergence of chariots.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  One can observe that chariots spread more swiftly in arid, open steppes. Their
  transmission was slower in forested areas and downstream marshlands of major
  rivers. In cold mountainous regions, the chariot's presence was virtually
  non-existent.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  This is because the tactical advantage of chariot technology was particularly
  evident in the plains. In swamps and forested areas, even though the chariot
  remained an advanced technology, its advantages were diminished, resulting in
  a slower spread.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  However, groups mastering chariot technology would modify terrains, like
  forests and marshes, to make them more chariot-friendly. They would drain
  swamps using hydraulic engineering, transforming them into prairie-like
  farmlands. Royal highways were built through forests and mountainous areas,
  facilitating smoother vehicular passage.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The King's Highway</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The concept of the King's Highway is one that the Chinese are well acquainted
  with. Dating back to the 3rd century BCE, the famed Qin expressways (秦驰道)
  and straight roads (直道) are testament to this. The expressways connected to
  the provinces and counties of the Qin Empire, serving both military and
  administrative functions. The straight roads led to the Hetao region's Jiuyuan
  county, situated on the southeastern edge of the Eurasian steppe.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  However, the concept of the King's Highway is not exclusive to East Asia. The
  Roman roads are clearly a parallel system. The Via Appia, built in 312 BCE,
  predates the Qin's straight roads by a century.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Even earlier, there was the Persian Empire's Royal Road. Historian Herodotus
  documented its construction in the 5th century BCE. However, archaeologists
  believe that its western half was constructed by the ancient Assyrian Empire,
  as early as the 7th century BCE. This Royal Road of the Persian Empire began
  on the eastern shores of the Aegean Sea, traversed challenging passes in
  Turkey, and ascended the 1000-meter-high Gulek Pass. It linked the Assyrian
  capital of Nineveh, present-day in Iraq, with Susa in modern-day Iran,
  stretching southeastward to the Persian capital of Persepolis. This Royal Road
  set the precedent for grand highways around the world. Notably, the Assyrian
  and Persian empires spanned what can be described as the golden age of
  chariots. These vast road networks made the deployment of chariots across
  challenging terrains on a grand scale possible.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>War Horses and the Middle Ages</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Chariots played a pivotal role in the military expansion across the Eurasian
  continent, leading to the rise of several civilizations. Notable among these
  are the Shang dynasty of China and the Aryan kingdoms of India. The trade
  routes of Central Asia, precursors to the famed Silk Road, developed in this
  context. The Age of Bronze, dominated by chariots, gradually gave way to the
  Iron Age, where cavalry began to assert its dominance. This transition was
  evolutionary rather than sudden.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The progression from the initial introduction of cavalry to its maturity
  required a series of technological breakthroughs. For instance, only small
  horses were suitable for pulling carts. Armored knights required larger,
  stronger horses to bear the weight of both the rider and the armor.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Advancements like the saddle, stirrups, and spurs enhanced the combat prowess
  of knights. By the time of the Five Barbarians and Sixteen Kingdoms, around
  the 4th century, these technologies were essentially mature. This period is a
  critical juncture, marking the boundary between ancient and medieval
  histories. The nomadic tribes from the Eurasian steppes, possessing vast
  numbers of war horses and formidable cavalry, toppled mighty empires like the
  Wei-Jin and Roman in a relatively short time frame.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The best-equipped cavalry legion in East Asian medieval history can be traced
  back to the fictional Murong Fu in Jin Yong's novels. However, his real-life
  counterparts—the armored cavalry of the Murong Xianbei and the Tuoba Xianbei
  during the Sixteen Kingdoms period—were unparalleled in subsequent
  generations. Their weaponry and armor shared lineage or influence prevalent
  across the Eurasian steppes, stretching from Omsk in Russia to the grasslands
  of Ukraine. During this era, Inner Asia undeniably became one of the world's
  focal points. From this point until the Mongol Empire's zenith, the trade
  routes of the Eurasian steppes, Central Asia, and North Asia were continually
  revitalized, birthing many significant cities and states during the Middle
  Ages.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Grassland Highways</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The transportation capabilities of horses and vehicles are ten times greater
  than human power, and their speed is even faster. This reduced the resistance
  within the Eurasian hinterland to just a tenth. During his military campaigns
  along the Black Sea, the Mongolian general Subutai reportedly slept on
  horseback and covered 2,000 kilometers in just a week. This remarkable pace
  has led to the legend of the "600-li express". It's akin to treating oneself
  as a courier package. The distance from Mongolia to the banks of Russia's
  Volga River spans more than 4,000 kilometers. Given such a riding pace, one
  could traverse the entire Eurasian steppe in just half a month. Although such
  a feat would be exhausting, in reality, using only a tenth of that speed,
  covering this distance in about six months is more realistic.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  While the carrying capacity of horse-drawn carriages and horses might be
  lesser than that of ships, their speed is comparable. Furthermore, they can
  access a wider range of terrains.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Thus, during Inner Asia's golden era, the famous Silk Road did not transport
  bulk goods that were usually carried by Mediterranean ships. Instead, it
  mainly facilitated the movement of luxury goods, precious metals, and
  weapons—high-value items. Heavy commodities were still majorly transported via
  seas, rivers, and canals. Yet, the grassland trade routes were exceptional in
  disseminating technology, especially military tech.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Cities such as Darius the Great's capital, Samarkand, Bukhara, Khotan, Kucha,
  and Chang'an, became pivotal hubs for medieval global trade.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Along the route from Constantinople to Chang'an or Ye City, many great empires
  emerged. To the west, there were the Sassanid Persian Empire, Abbasid
  Caliphate, Seljuk Empire, Ottoman Empire, Khwarezmian dynasty, and the Western
  Liao. To the east, the Former Qin Empire, Xianbei, Sui and Tang dynasties,
  Liao, Jin, Western Xia, and Mongol Empire made their mark. Their rise was
  deeply tied to controlling the grassland trade routes and mastering advanced
  military techniques.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  During the medieval period, the Eurasian steppe functioned as the world's
  largest highway and technology exchange center. A plethora of Central Asian
  products, techniques, and cultures flowed to East Asia during this window of
  opportunity. One can visualize a cosmopolitan Chang'an—diverse in languages,
  religions, ethnicities, and heavily influenced by Persian aesthetics.

</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>技术总是趋向于扩散，从拥有技术的地方扩散到不会这种技术的地方。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  各种物产从多余的地方扩散的不足的地方。有技术的人才也是。
  这种扩散过程，会产生很多利益。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这就好像一块石头，它静静地呆在山顶，一动不动。但是，如果允许它落向山下，这个过程，会释放出很大的能量。这种被释放出来的能量，我们很熟悉，是一种势能。势能，英文叫potential
  energy。也就是一种静态的时候不能释放，需要在运动中释放出来的能量。电路里，电流从电位高的地方流向电位低的地方。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>技术和物产，很明显也具有这种势能。有一种要传播和扩散的冲动。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>电阻论</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  但是，这种传播是有阻力的，就像电路有电阻一样。比如，深州的桃子，在100公里之外的石家庄应该是有人买的。可以说，深州有比较大桃子势能，桃子有向石家庄流动的趋势。但是，如果你是徒步，用肩膀背上几十斤桃子，走上三天三夜，到石家庄去卖，这样的时间消耗太大，路上吃住的花费大大可能超过去交易桃子的盈余。这就是赔本的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这就是两者之间的电阻太大，虽然存在电位差，但是电流无法导通。直到出现了骡子拉的大车，一次可以拉几百斤，它走的还比人快，这才降低了深州和石家庄之间的电阻，桃子贸易成为可能。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>——————————————————————————————————————</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>我今天，我给大家介绍一种理论。这种理论可能已经被别人发明过了。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  如果是这样，我也不妨重复发明一次。这个理论就是。当你看一张世界地图的时候，你可以把它看成一张电路图。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这里面，有的地方电位高。有的地方电位低。技术和物产，像电流一样，从势能高的地方流向势能低的地方。而两地之间存在电阻，是看他们之间的交通是否便捷，也要看运载工具是否高效。交通闭塞的地方和外界的阻力特别大，这样即便它们之间存在很大的势能差。也流动不起来。而交通特别便捷的几个地方之间，可能看起来距离很远，但是它们之间电阻很低，形成很强的流动，流动的结果，是这些地方之间的技术水平和物产的可得性拉平，形成一个近似于等势体区域。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>我下面试着把这种流动最大尺度的图景给大家展示一下。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>舟楫年代</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  人步行的负重能力是很弱的。在各种交通工具出现之前，只有非常珍贵的东西，才值得被带到别的地方。这里面主要包括燧石、黑曜石、盐、宝石之类的东西。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  所以，人最早发明的能够运载很多货物，足以进行大规模商业活动的交通工具，是独木舟。或者简单的帆船。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  独木舟是妥妥的石器时代科技。荷兰出土了目前发现的最老的独木舟，大概有1万年之老。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  史前时代的帆船，是独木舟的简单改良：在乌克兰、罗马尼亚的 &nbsp;<a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucuteni-Trypillian_culture"
    >Cucuteni-Trypillian</a
  >&nbsp;文化（库库特尼-特立皮里亚），出土了6000年前的帆船的遗迹。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  顺便说一下，有很多人认为，欧洲的上古时代是非常原始非常落后的。这其实是中国流行的一种非常荒谬的民间教育的误导。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  说回来，独木舟是一种非常强大的运载工具。一个人徒步负重几十公斤，进行长距离移动的速度是很慢的。一天走二三十公里就非常疲惫。但是，他划一条小舟，运载几百公斤的货物，甚至可以移动更快。也就是说独木舟，把地球上适合它使用的路线上的电阻，降低了几十倍。而排水量百吨以上的帆船，在这个基础上，又把电阻下降了十几倍。他们把适合通行的河流——比如多瑙河、尼罗河，还有近海——比如地中海、黑海、波罗的海、红海和阿拉伯海、东南亚沿海地区，变成了历史最早的技术的优良导体，海上高速公路。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  万年之前的古人，划独木舟，从非洲的索马里出发，沿着海岸线向东，曲曲折折，没吃的、没水的时候就上岸搜索；如果天气不好也靠岸躲避。这样，一直划到珠江口，需要多久呢？我估计现代人，如果带着钱和护照，可以上岸买东西的话，可能要花两年。史前时代的古人恐怕要慢一些。但是从技术的角度上说，花五年十年，也是完全可能的，他们只不过没有那么明确的长途交通动机，现实中他们一般只是做中短距离的航行。

  稻米，始终搞不清楚是在哪里发源的，今天在湄公河三角洲发现最古老的稻米，明天又从长江三角洲发现更古老的，后天又从珠江三角洲发现更更古老的。这种发现竞赛此起彼伏，但是实际上这三个地区属于高古时代近海贸易圈，一种发明在很短时间就能传播出去。所以你会发现时间相近的很多样本。

<p><strong>贸易风</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在亚热带，季风，也叫贸易风，每年周期性的反转方向。也使一年一度的周期性航行非常方便。
</p>

<p>
  其实，5000年前，从今天巴基斯坦境内印度河的Harrapa古城，到今天伊拉克境内的乌尔古城，需要多久呢？最多也就2个月。而且每年可以顺贸易风的方向往返一个来回。非常省力高效。5000年前的印度河流域文明，很大程度上来自美索不达米亚平原的两河文明的技术输出。技术通过海船传播到2000公里之外的印度河，造就了古代印度河文明。它们之间的贸易联系是非常清晰的。
</p>

<p>
  地中海地区是贸易风更大的受益者，3200年前，腓尼基人殖民地的遗址，东到今天黎巴嫩，西到葡萄牙和摩洛哥，彼此相距四五千公里。但是他们都属于同一个贸易圈，对彼此的存在非常了解。古希腊城邦，不是只在希腊的半岛。近的，爱琴海上所有的岛屿、克里特岛、小亚细亚的西岸各个城市、罗德岛、塞浦路斯、意大利南部布林迪西、塔兰托、那不勒斯、西西里岛的叙拉古。远的，东边到黑海的克里米亚、西边到今天属于法国的马赛，都属于希腊文化的范围。

  这个时代的主流交易品，包括：工艺品、皮草、琥珀、珍珠之类的比较昂贵的器物，也包括大宗商品粮食和橄榄油，这种大宗商品只有大船运输才划得来，尤其引人注目的交易品是制作青铜器必须的——锡矿石。制作青铜器同时需要铜矿和锡矿，铜矿是比较稀有的，锡矿就更加稀有，它关系到国家存废的兵器制造。在古代，锡矿石经常跨越几千公里，被运来运去，相当于今天的铀235，是一种战略物资。

  你可以想象，在沉寂的地球上，陆地上只有一些零零星星的微弱电流。然后，在近海和河流上，出现了比较强的电流，这些电流释放出的能量激活了这些通航的区域，并且让电流更加的持续和频密。它们发出的光好像给陆地镶上了金边，那是文明最早传播的地方。而此时的陆地上还是一片漆黑。一个雅典人对几百公里海外，肉眼看不见的的罗德岛非常熟悉，因为坐船2天就到了。对离他只有100公里，每天看着的内陆地区的奥利匹斯山，里面有什么一无所知，因为那里路是在太难走了。

  一个埃及人，他对尼罗河上下游千里的地方都不陌生，但是离开河几十公里的内陆沙漠，从来没敢去过。这就是早期文明所处的那个世界。

<p><strong>战车时代</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  内地，是不为人所知的，主要文明都在离海河大河不远的地方。这种情况被改变。来自于马和车轮。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  车轮的发明，在五六千年前。在两河流域、南北高加索地区、乌克兰、罗马尼亚地区，考古发现了基本同时期的车轮，说明这种技术的传播非常快。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>车轮发明之后，马才得到驯化。在没有马的时候，用牛拉车。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  马是一种替代牛的拉车牲口。最早驯化马的地方，被考古学家钉在了5000多年前，欧亚大草原，准确说是黑海北面的乌克兰地区。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>大家可以看出，上面提到过的地区都非常接近的，基本就是环绕黑海的地区。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  真正的战车，车轮带有辐条，这样的车才比较轻便。你把全世界出土的这种战车，按照它们的历史年代，画成等高线一样的等年代线。你会发现，最高的位置，也就是最早出现辐条战车的地方，在中亚，今天的俄罗斯联邦，靠近哈萨克斯坦共和国西北角这个州
  辛塔什塔一彼德罗夫卡这个地方。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  他是战车的发源地。全世界的上古战车，4000年前以这个地方为原点扩散开，花了200年时间，和它相邻的整个中亚地区和欧亚草原都出土了类似的战车。再过200年，扩散到美索不达米亚、中欧、印度河流域、蒙古高原、黄河上游、埃及；到了殷商武丁王的时代，从战车最初出现是800年的时间。这时候西欧、江淮地区、孟加拉三角洲地区还没有出现战车。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  你发现，战车在比较干旱开阔的草原地区传播的快。在森林和大河下游地沼泽地区传播得慢。在高寒山区则几乎没有得到传播。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  应为战车技术的军事优势在草原地区特别明显，它体现出的技术势能也就特别大。在沼泽和森林地区，虽然它仍然是先进的技术，但是它的优势打了折扣，传播的也会慢下来。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>但是，掌握战车技术的集团，会把森林和沼泽开发成适合战车发挥的地形。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  用水利工程排干沼泽，使其变成草原一样的农田。在森林和山脉中间开辟<strong>王家大道</strong>。这些都方便了车辆通行。

<p><strong>王家大道</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  王家大道，中国人非常熟悉，那就是公元前3世纪的，著名的秦驰道和直道，驰道通向秦帝国的郡县，也就是军区和行政区。直道通向河套地区的九原郡，那是欧亚大草原的东南边缘。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  王家大道，并非东亚独有。罗马大道，明显是一个类似的系统。阿比亚大道，312BC。比秦直道早一百年。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  更早的，是波斯帝国修建的王家大道。希罗多德记载是公元前5世纪修的。但是考古学家认为，它的西半段是古老的亚述帝国，早在7世纪之前修建的。波斯帝国的王家大道，从爱琴海东岸，穿过土耳其的险关，海拔1000米的古勒克山口，连接今天伊拉克境内的，亚述帝国的首都尼尼微，伊朗境内的苏萨，向东南到波斯帝国的首都，波斯波利斯。这个王家大道，是世界上王家大道的先驱。我们也知道，亚述帝国和波斯帝国，整合横跨了战车的黄金时代。这些大道，使战车跨越复杂崎岖的地形，大范围调动成为可能。

<p><strong>战马和中世纪</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  战车，方便了亚欧大陆上的军事扩张。催生了一系列国家。商帝国和印度雅利安各王国就在此列。中亚的商路，也就是通称的“丝绸之路”的前身，在这个过程中发育。战车称霸的青铜时代，逐渐被骑兵称雄的铁器时代取代。这是一个渐进的过程。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  骑兵从出现到成熟，要通过一系列的技术突破，比如，小马只适合拉车。需要比较高大强壮的马，才能身披甲胄的骑士。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  再比如马鞍、马镫、马刺等等，提高了骑士的战斗能力。在五胡十六国时期，也就是四世纪，基本成熟。这个时间点非常重要，它是上古历史和中古历史的分界点。来自欧亚大草原、拥有大量战马和可怕的骑兵的北方游牧，在很短的时间窗口内，摧垮了魏晋帝国和罗马帝国。东亚中世纪历史上装备最精良的骑兵军团，是金庸小说里虚构的慕容复，他现实中真正存在的祖先，十六国时代慕容鲜卑和拓跋鲜卑的重甲骑兵。他们的水平后世一直没有超过。他们装备的武器和盔甲，和当时整个欧亚草原，西到俄罗斯鄂木斯克、甚至乌克兰草原的骑兵的武器系统是同一个制式。
  这时的内亚地区俨然世界的核心。从这史到蒙古帝国时代，欧亚草原和中亚、北亚地区的商路不断被激活，在中世纪发育出很多重要城市和国家。

<p>草原高速公路</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  马匹、车辆的运输能力，是人力的十倍，速度还更快。它把欧亚大陆内地的电阻减少到1/10。蒙古大将速不台在黑海沿岸作战的时候，曾经在马背上睡觉，一个礼拜骑马跑了2000公里。这就是传说的600里加急的速度。把自己当成快递包裹了。从蒙古，到俄罗斯伏尔加河边，一共4000多公里。按照这种骑马速度，大半个月就能穿越整个欧亚大草原。当然这样太累了。但是现实中，你只用快递十分之一的速度，大半年穿越这个距离是比较正常的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  马车和马的运载能力，比船仍然要差很多，但是速度是不输给船只的。而且其可以到达的范围更大。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  所以，我们看到，在内亚的黄金时代，俗称的丝绸之路上也没有运输过地中海海船上那些大宗商品。被运来运去的主要是，奢侈品、贵金属和兵器之类高价值货物。运输的物资的总重量是不大的。大宗商品仍然主要在海、内河、运河上，通过船只进行。但是，草原商路，传播技术、特别是战争技术的能力是很强的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  大不里士、撒马尔罕、布哈拉、和田、龟兹、长安，这些内陆城市，成为中世纪全球贸易的枢纽城市。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  从君士坦丁堡到长安或者邺城，在这条路线上，崛起了很多大帝国。西面：萨珊波斯帝国、阿巴斯阿拉伯王朝、塞尔柱帝国、奥斯曼帝国、花腊子模、西辽；东面，苻坚帝国、鲜卑和隋唐帝国、辽、金、西夏、蒙古帝国。它们的崛起，都和占有草原贸易通道、掌握先进的军事技术有关。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在中古时代，欧亚大草原是全世界最大的高速公路和技术等势体。大量中亚的物产、技术和文化在这个窗口期传到东亚。你可以想象一个非常国际化、语言、宗教、人种都非常多元化，并且带有伊朗风格的长安。
