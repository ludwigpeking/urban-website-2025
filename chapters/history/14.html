<p>
  In our previous discussion, we touched upon the golden era of trade routes
  across the Eurasian steppes during the medieval period.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Canals</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  During this era, maritime and riverine navigation continued uninterrupted.
  Especially noteworthy were the canals. A single mule could carry around 120
  kilograms. Where roads existed, carts could be used, with a single cart
  capable of transporting over 600 kilograms. However, on water, one horse, when
  pulling a towpath, could drag a barge with a payload of up to 30 tons. This is
  50 times more efficient than cart transportation.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Typically, canals weren't entirely man-made from start to finish. Instead,
  they often utilized natural waterways wherever possible. When a natural river
  had segments with steep gradients, making upstream navigation impossible,
  canals could employ locks, functioning much like elevators, to elevate boats.
  This was one of the advantages of canals. Another characteristic of canals was
  the unstable water levels at the junctions of different basins. Some sections
  might lack water, rendering transportation impossible. In such situations,
  goods, often grains, would be offloaded and stored until water levels rose,
  making transportation feasible again.
</p>

<p>
  The Grand Canal, spanning from Beijing to Hangzhou, stands as the longest in
  history and was the most crucial canal in the ancient world. The canal, during
  the Sui Dynasty, originated in Kaifeng. Following the course of the Bian
  River, it passed through the Huai and Yangtze rivers, reaching all the way to
  Hangzhou. It transported a myriad of goods, primarily channeling the grain
  from the Suzhou-Hangzhou region to Kaifeng, and further to Luoyang or Chang'an
  to sustain the vast population of the capital region. As we can observe, the
  capitals of the Sui, Tang, and Five Dynasties gradually moved southeast along
  the canal, shifting from Chang'an to Luoyang, then to Kaifeng, and
  occasionally even relocating to Yangzhou. This shift shortened transport
  routes, reduced transportation costs, and was driven by the dynasties'
  strategic imperatives.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  During the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, the primary role of the canal was
  to transport grains from the southern regions to Beijing. Thus, the route was
  adjusted to a more direct path, bypassing Kaifeng and instead passing through
  Shandong.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In the Ming and Qing dynasties, the canal functioned like a highway within the
  empire or could be viewed as the empire's technological artery. Along the
  canal, major northern commercial cities emerged, from north to south,
  including Tongzhou, Tianjin, Cangzhou, Linqing (the backdrop for the story
  "Jin Ping Mei"), Xuzhou, Huai'an , and Yangzhou.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Tolls collected from the canal constituted a significant portion of the
  empire's fiscal revenue. The professional managers overseeing this revenue
  formed a distinct societal class.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  When police investigate criminal cases, by observing the modus operandi, they
  can determine the county the perpetrator hails from, reflecting the
  continuation of certain techniques across generations. During the Middle Ages,
  from Italy to Poland, and from the Middle East's Baghdad to Samarkand, the
  majority involved in commerce and finance activites in the cites were Jews.
  They constituted a significant portion of the urban population. The major
  medieval city of Kaifeng even had a Jewish community. Similar to the Jews,
  Armenians were widespread across the Near East and Middle East, often forming
  Christian business communities. During the era of the Republic of China,
  Harbin had a sizable Armenian community. In medieval South Asia and Southeast
  Asia, Muslims dominated the merchant class, and many cities had Muslim
  communities, though they were less prevalent in rural areas.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  At each of the toll stations along the Grand Canal of China, the professionals
  managing the revenue and taxation often hailed from Shaoxing, known as
  "Shaoxing Shiyi (clerks from Shaoxing)." When they moved to other regions,
  they would be termed as "Cangzhou Shiyi" or other similar titles, based on
  their new location. Zhou Enlai's ancestors were among the Shaoxing Shiyi,
  managing the toll stations in Huai'an. In his youth, Zhou went to Tianjin for
  his studies. If one understands the significance of the Grand Canal, they'd
  recognize that such patterns of movement weren't random.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Northern Chinese traditional dishes aren't highly regarded, while Huaiyang
  cuisine is quite acclaimed. Along the Grand Canal, between the two, lies the
  cuisine of Shandong, or "Lu Cai." Lu Cai outstands from the northern cuisins,
  and Beijing cuisine is largely its descendant. These culinary styles spread
  along the canal. Similarly, Peking Opera, or "Jingju," evolved as a result of
  southern opera troupes moving to and developing in Beijing.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Canals served as efficient conduits in the Middle Ages but with conditions.
  Their upkeep demanded the resources of vast empires. The consumption and
  extraction they facilitated might often overshadow their production value.
  This feature was especially pronounced in China. A declined empire loses its
  ability to sustain the functionality of the Grand Canal.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Canals were an efficient medieval conductor of branch lines. It needs the
  maintenance of a great empire. And his absorbability and consumption may be
  greater than productivity. Its dimension is more prominent in China.
</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Pre-Modern Maritime Trade Era</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Let's return to the overarching narrative. The golden age of cavalry saw the
  rise of powerful empires like the Göktürks Khaganate and Mongol Empire, as
  well as prosperous inland trade routes.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  However, the emergence of another mode of transportation was undermining the
  foundations of these Inner Asian Empires' success. During the Middle Ages,
  while horsemen dominated the continents, seafaring was still slowly evolving.
  The deep-sea navigation abilities of the Middle Ages are often overlooked.
  This isn't to say that long-distance sea voyages did not exist; they were
  simply high-risk.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  When the Eastern Jin Dynasty Chinese monk, Faxian, traveled to India, he
  traversed the Pamir Plateau on foot. But on his return to the Eastern Asia, he
  sailed from Bengal, passed through Sri Lanka, and arrived in Java. From Java,
  he set off for the Chinese coast. He initially aimed for Canton but was blown
  off course to the Shandong Peninsula. Faxian wasn't a sailor; he learned
  during his travels along the Ganges that maritime routes were more convenient
  for returning trip. The sea routes he traveled were well-established by then.
  This implies that these maritime trade routes always existed but were not
  documented by intellectuals like Faxian before.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Another monk from the Tang Dynasty, Yijing, traveled directly by boat, passing
  through Sumatra to reach India.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The Sinbad voyages tell tales of medieval Arab traders sailing the Indian
  Ocean. In reality, these Arab traders had an expansive range of activities,
  reaching the coastlines of the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Huang Daopo learned advanced cotton spinning techniques in Hainan Island.
  Though some sources say she learned from the indigenous Li people, it's
  evident that she learned from workers involved in widespread commodity
  circulation, rather than from hunter-gatherer tribes. Recent archaeological
  discoveries in Hainan indicate the presence of medieval Muslim towns and
  burial sites. Cotton and cotton spinning technology originated in India and
  the Middle East. Huang Daopo likely learned these techniques from Muslim
  traders in Hainan's commercial towns. By the Tang Dynasty, Muslims were
  already active in Canton. By the Song and Yuan Dynasties, in major maritime
  trade cities like Quanzhou (or Cayton), the community leader was a Sunni
  Muslim named "Pu Shougeng(蒲寿庚)", whose original name can be speculated as
  Abu Sayyid Khan. Yuan army garrisons had 3,000 Shiite Muslims. Besides
  Muslims, there were also Jewish merchants and various Christian sects,
  including the Franciscans. Huang Daopo's story is essentially about a young
  woman from Shanghai who traveled south for work, acquired skills, and returned
  home to become wealthy. The narrative suggesting she learned from the Li
  mountain tribes is highly questionable.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Zheng He, too, is part of this tradition. As is well known, Zheng He was a
  Muslim, and his father had been to Mecca. His position as fleet commander was
  related to his background, language skills, and social resources. The places
  his fleet reached, like the Red Sea and Mombasa in East Africa, might have
  been unfamiliar to the Ming emperor but were well-traversed routes for Zheng
  He's original community.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  All these were precursors to the Age of Exploration. The spread of technology
  due to maritime advancements began to outpace that of the continents. The
  phenomenon of Wokou (Japanese pirates) is a late manifestation of this trend.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Age of Sails</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The ultimate breakthrough was a new type of ship, the caravel, invented by the
  Portuguese. This sleek ship, along with its upgraded version, the carrack, was
  transformative.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The Portuguese were not accidental innovators. Portugal emerged from the
  Reconquista, the medieval Christian reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula from
  the Muslims. As the westernmost European nation, all its coastlines face the
  treacherous high seas of Atlantic. Deep-sea fishing was almost an inevitable
  industry. Moreover, Portugal could assimilate both European and Arab maritime
  technologies from the Mediterranean region.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The new Portuguese long-distance ships had advantages over previous coastal
  trading vessels:
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol>
  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    Their hulls were higher, better able to withstand waves, enhancing their
    reliability.
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>They could sail across oceans.</li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    They relied solely on sails, eliminating the need for numerous rowers and
    reducing supply burdens.
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    They could sail against the wind, a critical ability on Africa's west coast,
    where winds blow consistently in one direction.
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Skipping over a detailed exposition, let's summarize the results: With the
  advent of the Age of Sails, maritime technology dissemination outstripped that
  of the continents. According to my theory of resistance, oceanic resistance
  decreased by a factor of 100. Such low resistance led to electric currents
  flowing across oceans, reaching previously unexplored lands like the Americas
  and Australia. These currents grew stronger, interconnecting almost all
  coastal regions worldwide. As a result, inland currents, which previously
  flourished, began to diminish.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The matchlock, which Europeans had only recently adopted in 15th century, was
  sold by the Portuguese to Japan in 1543, just a century later, where it was
  massively replicated and named after the place of its introduction:
  "Tanegashima".
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Nagasaki, Kobe, and Yokohama became some of Japan's earliest industrialized
  cities due to their early trade with the West. In India, the port cities of
  Mumbai and Kolkata economically overshadowed Delhi, the former imperial
  capital. In China, Guangzhou and Shanghai symbolize modern maritime-driven
  globalization. In contrast, cities like Samarkand, Dunhuang, and Chang'an
  epitomized the grandeur of the Middle Ages when places like Guangzhou and
  Shanghai were of lesser significance.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  However, as the trade routes of the Eurasian steppes declined, people no
  longer viewed Central Asia as a source of precious goods or mysterious
  technologies. Their tales faded from popular memory, leaving behind enigmatic
  scrolls and caves.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Steamboats</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  As we peer into the latter half of the maritime age, the steamboat emergents.
  The advent of the steamboat boosted ship speeds by more than double, making
  them less susceptible to the influences of wind direction and ocean currents.
  This reduced the resistance faced on the seas once more.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  However, it was the inland waterways that were truly revolutionized by
  steamboats. Before their invention, sailing against the current—battling
  gravity and water flow—required manual labor to tow, a highly challenging
  feat.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Chongqing offers a particularly notable example. The middle and lower reaches
  of the Yangtze River had always been convenient for navigation. Yet, sailing
  against the current from Yichang, passing through the Three Gorges to reach
  the Sichuan Basin, was an arduous journey. The emergence of steamboats,
  however, normalized this mode of transport. Chongqing, almost overnight in the
  late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China period, exploded into
  prominence, becoming the "Hong Kong of Sichuan"—a transformation largely
  attributed to the steamboat.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Initially, sailing vessels journeyed against the Hudson River's current from
  New York, heading inland only as far as Albany. But with the rise of
  steamboats, upstream travel became easier. Powered by this innovation,
  Americans carved out modern canals—the Erie Canal and the Chicago Canal. This
  connected New York to the entirety of the Great Lakes and the Midwest,
  providing a cost-effective transportation network.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Consequently, docks, warehouses, and commodity stocks emerged along the
  Hudson, paving the way for futures trading, finance, insurance, and
  manufacturing sectors. While New York's history as a world capital can be
  linked to sailing vessels, it was decidedly shaped by steamboats.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The East Coast, the Great Lakes, the Mississippi Basin, and the Ohio River
  region were interconnected, forming a vast circular zone of equal potential,
  sparking an immense flow of activity. Within this zone emerged many pillars of
  modern industry: Pittsburgh's steel, Detroit's cars, and Cleveland's
  petrochemicals, to name a few. Some businesses, within a short time, boosted
  their labor productivity by a factor of 100, even up to 10,000. These feats
  weren't just their own making. The environment—characterized by low resistance
  and strong flows—facilitated the abundant supply and transportation of goods.
  More importantly, there was efficient matching of technology and capital.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Railway</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The next world-changing, resistance-reducing mode of transport I'll discuss is
  the railway.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In the days before railroads, the most important port on the Liaodong
  Peninsula was Yingkou. Sea shipping was the most cost-effective, so one would
  prefer ships to cover longer distances, minimizing expensive land travel.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  However, once railways were established, transport on land shifted to trains.
  For ships coming from overseas, it was inevitable to transfer goods to trains
  upon docking. Given this, it was more expedient to dock at the land's edge. As
  a result, the most significant port on the Liaodong Peninsula shifted to
  Dalian.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Yantai, once more crucial than Qingdao, lost its significance after the Qing
  Dynasty when the railway between Qingdao and Jinan was completed. Qingdao soon
  eclipsed Yantai.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In the USA, during the latter half of the 19th century, railways extended
  towards the western frontier. Before this, much of the vast North American
  West was largely excluded from the global economic map. In other words, it
  existed in a setting reminiscent of the Stone Age, marked by faint electric
  currents and high resistance. With the completion of the Transcontinental
  Railroad, this area was fully integrated into the global economic circuit.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  What's even more evident is the rise of California's economy. In 2018,
  California boasted a GDP of $3 trillion. If California were treated as a
  standalone country, its GDP would rank just below the top four – the US,
  China, Japan, and Germany; and surpassing the UK, France, and India, making it
  the fifth largest in the world. Washington State, where Seattle is located,
  has a GDP of $500 billion, roughly equivalent to that of Argentina.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The Siberian Railway in Russia connected its European regions to the Far East.
  This development greatly amplified Russia's economic, political, and military
  presence on the Far Eastern coast. It also intensified tensions between Russia
  and Japan, leading to a power imbalance and culminating in the Russo-Japanese
  War.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Moreover, the Siberian Railway extended the USSR's influence over Central Asia
  and the Far East. During the subsequent Soviet-German War, the resources
  transported by this railway became vital for the Soviet Union's survival.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Compared to camel caravans and wagons, railways reduced transportation costs
  by about 50 times. Beijing transitioned from a medieval land port, where
  camels lined up outside the city gates, to a central railway hub.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Roads and railways further slashed inland transportation costs to more
  acceptable levels. This rejuvenated cities around the world, while cities
  situated along canals saw a decline in their status. Numerous canals worldwide
  were abandoned or transformed into tourist attractions, akin to what we
  observe along the Potomac River in places like London or Washington, D.C.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Railways have been city creators. Harbin emerged from the intersection of the
  Siberian Railway's extensions in China – the East China Railway and the
  Harbin-Dalian Railway. Cities like Shijiazhuang and Zhengzhou rose from
  intersections of the Beijing-Hankou Railway with the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan and
  Longhai railways respectively. Warren Buffett's hometown, Omaha, became a
  convergence point for railways in the eastern and western parts of the US.
  This is why these cities have developed into modern regional centers, and the
  origin of their cultural heritage.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Flatness and Disparity</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Following railways, major technological leaps in infrastructure emerged, such
  as the telegraph, telephone, and airplanes. The internet can be perceived as
  an enhancement in bandwidth of telephone and telegraph technologies.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Thus, the speed and bandwidth of information transfer expanded infinitely,
  while costs plummeted to almost zero. The costs associated with the movement
  of goods decreased by thousands of times compared to the Stone Age. The entire
  planet moved closer to a state of technological equilibrium, where electric
  currents could virtually reach anywhere.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Today, the inland region of Guizhou has become a hub for big data. Advanced
  research projects, like the FAST radio telescope, are situated there.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Inland cities in the US like Nevada, Salt Lake City, Denver, and Phoenix have
  developed economically on par with coastal regions, even surpassing many areas
  worldwide. Transportation costs are no longer the primary or most sensitive
  expense.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  However, despite these advancements, the world we observe today remains full
  of disparities. As transportation costs reduced, other transaction costs
  became more noticeable.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  While new trends emerge, global business hubs are still primarily those cities
  that have long-standing commercial histories. The advantages they possess stem
  from their traditions – economic activities are path-dependent and continue
  along established trajectories. Traditional businesses and their practitioners
  have better reputations and stronger training capabilities, suggesting that
  traditional business networks likely hold cost advantages.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Other disparities exist in the world, like environmental differences. Some
  individuals might leave Beijing due to its air quality, retiring or
  vacationing in the South, which is a milder difference. However, more
  pronounced is the climate disparity – New York's film industry gradually
  shifted to Los Angeles, given the year-round filming conditions. Populations
  in the northeastern and northern parts of the US continue to decrease, while
  those in the south and west increase, climate plays a role as higher equipment
  efficiency and lower heating expenses. In warm Hainan Island, we see most of
  the immigrants from cold Heilongjiang.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Such disparities, capable of altering these traditional paths, give rise to
  new trends. However, the more potent disparities are those related to
  governance and politics.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Gulf nations like Qatar, Bahrain, and the UAE, when considering oil resources,
  geography, and population, don't differ significantly from other larger Middle
  Eastern nations. In ancient times, these smaller nations went unnoticed. Yet,
  the disparities in their political and judicial environments have led to their
  prosperity, in stark contrast to the difficulties of their neighbors.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  North and South Korea share similar traditions and peoples, yet their vast
  disparities in political environments have set them on divergent paths. While
  their contrasting internet policies offer a glimpse into these differences,
  they are emblematic of the broader and profound policy disparities that define
  each nation.

<p><strong>14 大图景——技术势能和电阻论</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>上期讲到了中古时代，欧亚大草原商路的黄金时期。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>在这个时期中，海、内河的航运仍然在继续。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>特别是运河，也可以注意一下。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  每只骡子可以驮运120公斤，有路的地方可以用大车的情况，大车可以拉600多公斤。但是在水上，一匹马拉纤，可以拉动载重30吨的驳船。比大车运输效率高50倍。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  通常，运河并不是从头到尾都是人工开凿的，而是尽量利用自然河道。自然河道，在有些河段落差太大，没法逆流而上，这种情况下，运河可以通过船闸，像电梯一样把船升到高处。这是运河的一个优点。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  运河还有一个特点是，在不同流域的结合部，水位经常不太稳定。有点河段没有水。无法运输。这时候，就需要把粮食卸下来，装进仓库。等到有水的时候再运输。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  京杭大运河，是历史上最长的，也是古代世界最重要的运河。隋朝的运河是从开封出发。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  沿着汴河的方向，穿过淮河和长江，一直到杭州。它运输很多东西，但是，最主要的是把苏杭的粮食运往开封，再继续运往洛阳或者长安。以供养首都地区庞大的人口。你可以看到隋、唐五代的都城，都是自西北向东南，沿着运河移动，从长安迁到洛阳，又迁到开封，有时候索性迁到扬州。这种移动可以缩短运输线，节省运输成本，是王朝的求生欲望使然。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  元明清时代，运河的主要角色是把江南的粮食运到北京。于是取直线，不在经过开封，而是从山东境内经过。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  明清时代的运河，是当时王朝内的高速公路，或者说是帝国内的技术等势体。沿着运河，形成北方最主要的商业城市，从北向南。通州、天津、沧州、临清（也就是金瓶梅故事背景的那个商业城市）、、徐州、淮安（也就是周恩来的故乡）、扬州（也就是江泽民的故乡）

</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  和犹太人类似，亚美尼亚人在近东、和中东地区、以基督教商业社区的形式分布很广，在民国时代的哈尔滨曾经有很大的亚美尼亚人社区。

  运河的各个税关上，经营财税的职业经理人，经常出自绍兴，也就是著名的绍兴师爷。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>他们到了其他地方，就成为沧州师爷或者其他的师爷。</p>

  北方的传统饭菜是不太行的，淮阳菜是不错的。连着运河。他们两者之间，夹着一个鲁菜。但是鲁菜还可以。北京菜是鲁菜的后代。这些菜式是沿着运河传导的。京剧也一样，是南方的戏班子去北京发展的结果。

<p>中世纪，当骑士称霸大陆的时候。航海仍然在缓慢发展。</p>

  中世纪的远洋航海能力经常被忽视，但是并不是说中世纪没有远洋航海。只是风险比较大。

  东晋的法显和尚，他去印度的时候，是步行翻越帕米尔高原的。但是，他回东晋，是从孟加拉坐船，经过斯里兰卡到了爪哇岛。然后从爪哇出发会唐朝，本来想去广州，结果被海潮直接吹到了山东半岛。
</p>

  法显不是航海家，他显然是在恒河流域旅行中，逐渐了解到海路回国更加方便。而且他走的这些航程，是搭乘当时已经很成熟的航线。也就是说这些海上贸易路线一直都存在，只不过没有被像法显这样的知识分子把它们记录下来。

<p>唐代的义净和尚，干脆就是直接乘船，经过苏门答腊岛，到达印度的。</p>

  辛巴达航海，讲的是中世纪阿拉伯商人在印度洋航行的故事。现实中的阿拉伯商人，实际上活动范围遍及印度洋和东南亚沿海。

  黄道婆在海南学习了先进的棉纺织技术，和谁学的没有说。有些材料说是和原住民黎族学习的。但是事实上，显然不是那种生活在自然状态的狩猎采集部落。掌握先进棉纺技术的必然是参与大范围商品流通的城市化居民。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  但是，考古发现，在海南岛有中世纪穆斯林城镇和墓地。印度和中东地区才是棉花和棉纺技术的发源地。黄道婆显然是从当时海南的工商业城镇里。学习了穆斯林国际贸易者携带的棉纺技术。早在唐代，穆斯林在广州就已经非常活跃。宋代元代，在航海贸易大城市，比如泉州，他的社区领袖，是一个汉字名字写成“蒲寿庚”的逊尼派穆斯林，而元军的驻军是三千名什叶派穆斯林。除去穆斯林，这个城里犹太商人、各种教派的基督徒，包括方济各会都毫不新鲜。黄道婆明显是一个南下打工的上海女生，学会了技术回家发财的故事。所以和黎族山民学纺织这一系列脑补的故事可以说是十足猪脑。
</p>

  郑和，也是这一传统的一部分。众所周知，郑和也是穆斯林，他父亲就去过麦加。他做舰队司令，和它的出身背景、语言能力和社会资源有关系。而他的大舰队所到达的地方，包括红海和东非蒙巴萨等，对于明朝皇帝来说，可能很陌生。但是对于郑和所出身的圈子来说，这些都属于成熟的航线。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这些，就是大航海时代的前奏。航海发展带来的技术扩散，逐步超过内陆。倭寇现象，就是这种趋势后期的一个表征。

  但是最后突破的，是一种新型的海船。那就是葡萄牙人发明的卡拉维尔，一种船身光滑的新型海船。还有它的升级版，卡拉克，也被翻译成“大帆船”。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  葡萄牙人承担起这个角色绝非偶然。葡萄牙这个国家，是中世纪后期，基督教从穆斯林手中收复伊比利亚半岛战争的产物。它是欧洲最西南的国家，和其他欧洲国家的差别是，它全部的海岸线都朝向风急浪高的大西洋外海。这里，远洋渔业可以说是一种必然的产业。另一方面，它可以完整地继承地中海地区欧洲和阿拉伯的航海技术。
</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>葡萄牙人的新型远洋船只，和之前的近海贸易船只比起来，</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  1）它船舷更高，更能承受风浪；所以他的可靠性大大提高。安全可靠是它贡献的最大价值。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2）它可以跨大洋航行。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  3）完全靠风帆，不需要大量的浆手，这样就只需要很少的船员，大大减少了补给负担。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  3）它靠风帆就可以逆风行驶。在常年风朝一个方向吹的非洲西岸，这种能力非常重要，否则你就有去无回了。
</p>

<p>后面，我省略一万字。</p>

<p>
  我们只说结果。简单的说，大帆船时代，海上的技术传播速度再次超过内陆。按照电阻理论。海洋的电阻下降了100倍。要知道，电阻特别小，就会短路。你看到世界的各个海洋上都产生电流。包括那些以前无人问津的大洋，这些电流一直延伸到美洲、澳洲这些新大陆。这些电流越来越强。几乎把世界上所有的沿海地区短路了。以至于，从前，在内陆、运河里的电流减弱。

  欧洲人用上火绳枪还没几年，这种东西就已经被葡萄牙人卖到了日本，以它登陆的地点“种子岛”的名字在日本大量被仿制。

  但是，欧亚草原商路衰败了，人们不再认为中亚有他们渴望的珍惜货物和神秘技术了。人们甚至对那里发生过的故事不再熟悉了。留下了神秘的卷轴和洞窟。

<p>蒸汽船</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  我们看，在航海时代的后半程，蒸汽船又出现了。蒸汽船把船速提升了1倍多。而且更加不受风向和洋流的影响。整个海洋的电阻再次下降。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  真正被蒸汽船改变的，是内河航道。蒸汽船发明之前，逆水而上，克服重力和水流，需要纤夫拖拽，是非常困难的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  重庆，是一个特别突出的例子。长江中下游通航自古都是非常方便的。但是从宜昌，要逆流而上，经过三峡到达巴蜀是非常困难的。但是，蒸汽船的出现一举让这种交通变得平常。重庆，在清末民初瞬间爆发成为巴蜀的香港，几乎完全是蒸汽船出现的结果。

  开始，帆船从纽约沿着哈德孙河逆流而上，向腹地进发，只能航行到奥尔巴尼Albany。但是，蒸汽船出现之后，逆流而上变得容易。被这种动力所驱使，美国人开凿了现代运河——伊利运河和芝加哥运河。这样纽约就和整个五大湖和中西部地区有了非常低成本的运输工具。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  于是，在哈德孙河边出现了码头、仓库和大宗商品存货，从而发展出期货、金融、保险产业和加工行业。纽约做为世界首都的历史，和帆船有关，但是肯定是蒸汽船决定的。

  东海岸、五大湖、密西西比流域、俄亥俄河地区连为一体，形成一个巨大的环形等势体。爆发出巨大的电流。

  这里面发育出现代工业的很多门类，匹兹堡的钢铁、底特律的汽车，克利夫兰的石油化工等等，一些企业在短时间内，把劳动生产率提高100倍，甚至10000倍。这些成就当然不是仅仅靠他们自己实现的。电阻很小、电流非常强大的大环境，让物料和产品充分的供应和运输。更重要的技术和资金的高效匹配。

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>我下面要讲的新的改变世界电阻的交通工具，是铁路。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在没有铁路的年代，辽东半岛最重要的港口是营口。海轮的运输成本最低，你希望开船尽量走远一点距离，这样能够在运输昂贵的陆路少走一些。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  但是，在铁路修通之后，在陆地上，是用火车运输了。而你开船从海外而来，把货物卸到岸上，迟早要换上火车。这样，迟上不如早上，索性在陆地最边缘就上岸吧。于是，辽东半岛最重要的港口变成了大连。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  烟台，曾经是比青岛重要的港口，但是，清末，在青岛到济南的铁路修通之后，烟台被短路了，很快被青岛反超。
</p>

<p>
  在美国，19世纪后半叶，铁路通向西部边疆。在此之前，广大的北美西部的大部分地区。是在世界经济版图之外的。也就是，处于高电阻，的石器时代的微弱电流的环境中。在横贯大陆铁路建成之后，整个进入了全球经济循环。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  你更会看到，加州经济的崛起。2018的加州，有3万亿美元的GDP。加州如果单独看成一个国家，它的GDP仅仅低于美中日德四国；高于英国、法国和印度，排世界第五。西雅图所在的华盛顿州，GDP5000亿，大概相当于阿根廷。

  俄罗斯的西伯利亚铁路，把俄罗斯的欧洲部分和远东部分连接起来。它极大的增加了俄国在远东海岸的经济、政治和军事存在。激起了俄国和日本的一系列矛盾，俄日力量对比失衡，并且爆发了日俄战争。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  西伯利亚铁路也扩大之后苏联对中亚和远东的影响力。在后来苏德战争中，铁路输送的远东资源也对苏联的生存至关重要。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  和驼队、大车相比；铁路把运输成本大概降低了50倍。北京，从一个城门外骆驼排成大队的中世纪陆运港口，变成了铁路中心城市。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  公路和铁路一起，把内陆运输的成本再次下降到一个可以接受的水平。全世界内陆城市有所复兴。而运河沿线城市的地位后退，全世界大量运河被废弃、或者变成我们在伦敦或者华盛顿特区波托马克河边等地方看到的观光景点。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  铁路本身就制造城市，哈尔滨是西伯利亚铁路在清国的支线——东清铁路和哈大铁路的交叉点。石家庄、郑州，是京汉铁路分别和石太铁路、陇海铁路的交叉点。巴菲特的家乡——奥马哈，是美国东西部铁路的汇合点。这是这些城市成为现代区域中心城市的原因，也是他们文化传统的来源。

  紧随铁路而来的重要基础设施的技术飞跃是——电报、电话和飞机。互联网，你可以认为是电话和电报技术带宽的放大。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>——————————————————————</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这样，信息的传递的速度和带宽，无限被被放大，成本几乎下降为0。物产流动的成本，和石器时代相比，下降了上万倍。整个地球趋近于技术的等势体，电流几乎可以通往任何地方。

  美国内陆的内华达、盐湖城、丹佛和凤凰城，他们的经济发展水平不亚于美国的沿海地区；更是远远超过世界上的多数地区。运输成本已经不是最主要、最敏感的成本。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

  然而，我们今天看到的这个世界仍然充满差别。在运输成本下降之后，其他种类的交易成本变得敏感。

  世界发达的商业城市，虽然有新的趋势在产生，但是仍然主要集中在近代之间就已经存在的那些商业城市。这些城市具有的优势主要是它们的传统——经济活动，存在路径依赖，还会沿着传统的路径运行。传统的企业和传统的从业者具有更好的商业信誉，他们也掌握着培训能力。传统的商业网络，因此很可能具有交易成本的优势。

  这个世界上还有很多其他的势差，比如环境势差——有人嫌弃北京的空气，去南方退休或者度假，这种势差比较柔和；更明显的，有气候势差——纽约的电影行业逐渐转移到洛杉矶，因为洛杉矶一年四季都可以拍摄外景。这样设备的使用效率就更高。而且采暖费用更低。美国东北地区和北部地区的人口持续减少，而南部和西部人口增加。
</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>在海南岛我们看到很多黑龙江人。</p>

  这些，能够改变这种传统路径的势差，造成一些新的趋势。但是，更强烈的势差是司法的势差、政治势差。
</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  波斯湾小国、卡塔尔、巴林、阿联酋，从石油资源、地理和人口上看，和周边的其他中东大国的差别不大，在古代，这些小国也默默无闻，但是他们的政治环境和司法环境的势差。造成了他们的繁荣和周边衰落的巨大反差。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

  朝鲜和韩国，具有相似的传统和人民，但是政治的势差给两边带来了天壤之别；两国的互联网政策，虽然给技术阻力带来了差别，但是它只是两国差别的一个小小的缩影。
