<p>
  In this chapter we discuss the phenomenon of the suburbanization of cities.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In the field of urban studies, suburbanization is a significant topic, and for
  good reason. If we look at today's cities, suburban areas have far exceeded
  the size of the urban core. Taking the United States as an example, more than
  half of the population resides in the suburbs, surpassing both urban and rural
  areas combined. So, today, it's more accurate to say that we live in a
  suburban era. But what exactly is suburbanization?
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>the Definition of Suburbanization</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Before the 19th century, cities were relatively small, typically with
  diameters of 1-2 kilometers. Even major capitals like Constantinople and Yuan
  Dynasty's Dadu (modern Beijing) had diameters of only 5-6 kilometers. The
  population and building density within the city were quite high, ranging from
  5,000 to 50,000 people per square kilometer. Beyond the city limits lay rural
  areas with very low population and building density, often more than ten times
  lower. Visually, these two areas were distinct and easily separated.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  However, in the 19th century and especially today, cities have grown
  significantly, often spanning 30-50 kilometers in diameter. Around the densely
  populated urban core, there are areas with intermediate density, falling
  somewhere between the urban core and the countryside. This is what we refer to
  as the suburbs. The term "suburb" comes from Latin, meaning "near the city" or
  "secondary urban area." Suburbanization is the rapid expansion of these
  secondary urban areas. To put it simply, there have been two major waves of
  transportation technology that have driven suburbanization.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Two Waves</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The first wave began in the 19th century with public transport systems like
  trams/trains. These became widespread in developed countries around 1900 and
  continue to evolve today in the form of subways, light rail, and other
  systems.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The second wave, which came in the 20th century, brought the widespread
  adoption of automobiles and the construction of road networks. The peak of
  this adoption was after World War II, and it's still ongoing in developing
  countries today, meaning its peak is yet to come.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The first wave, driven by trams and subways, led to suburbs with relatively
  higher population densities compared to the second wave, driven by
  automobiles. In fact, today, trains are not even considered a major factor in
  suburbanization by urban planning professionals. Instead, they are seen as
  factors in urban renaissance. Trams and subways are viewed positively by
  professionals, while the image of car-centric suburbanization is often seen as
  negative, especially in the context of carbon neutrality and carbon reduction
  efforts. Most experts do not consider widespread car adoption in the
  developing world as an environmentally viable option. However, we need to face
  a fact: the second wave, driven by cars, has had a far more significant impact
  on suburbanization. The expansion of city limits has emphasized the advantages
  of automobiles, intensified the market's reliance on cars, created a positive
  feedback loop, and exacerbated the situation. Furthermore, in the future, I
  believe that cars are unlikely to yield their share to public transport
  systems but will give way to shared car systems, especially autonomous vehicle
  systems. I discussed this issue in Episode 37 (Podcast&lt;陈腐粉碎机&gt;).

<p><strong>Revisit into the History</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  We've previously discussed several concepts. Before the 19th century, most
  people traveled by foot, with an average speed of about 80 meters per minute.
  Traditional cities were built around this mode of transportation. Traditional
  cities generally fell into three size categories:
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol>
  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    Small cities with diameters of 1-2 kilometers, housing a few thousand to
    tens of thousands of people. Most places in these cities were within a
    15-minute walk. Many ancient and medieval cities fit into this category.
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    Larger cities with diameters of 2-3 kilometers, home to tens of thousands to
    over a hundred thousand people. Most places were within a half-hour walk.
    Examples include Uruk, Florence, and Venice.
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    Imperial cities with diameters of around 5 kilometers or more. These large
    cities, which were not common before modern times, could have populations
    ranging from hundreds of thousands to over a million people. Most places
    were within an hour's walk. Examples include 4th-century Rome, 7th-century
    Chang'an, Constantinople, 18th-century Edo (modern Tokyo), 13th-century
    Hangzhou, and 14th-century Dadu (modern Beijing). Cities of this scale often
    had populations that far exceeded what the surrounding agricultural areas
    could provide for, relying on significant food imports and serving as
    central hubs for extensive regions.
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  These were the traditional cities before suburbanization. Their boundaries
  were clear, with a clear distinction between the urban core and the
  countryside. Just beyond the city gates, there might be small commercial
  communities, followed by relatively homogeneous rural areas with a few villas,
  farms, and extensive fields, pastures, and forests. Wealthy individuals could
  afford suburban villas. For example, Louis XIV regularly resided in the Palace
  of Versailles in the suburbs of Paris, essentially his villa, but he rarely
  visited the city itself. Nobles living in the suburbs was based on the premise
  that they didn't need to work in the city.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Streetcar Suburbs</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Until the appearance of trains/trolleys, people could only live in the suburbs
  at night and commute to work in the city during the day. Then the boundaries
  between the suburbs and the urban core began to blur. This marked the
  beginning of suburbanization.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Here, the term "train" refers to a range of transportation modes, including
  earlier horse-drawn tramcars, often called "trams" or "trolleys," steam or
  internal combustion engine-driven cable cars, which were not self-propelled
  but were pulled along tracks by a cable, generally referred to as "cableways,"
  and vehicles that resemble today's streetcars/subways, including various forms
  of buses, subways, and light rail, which are their successors. Although their
  efficiency improved over time, their fundamental function remained largely
  unchanged. Therefore, we can discuss them as a category. Their defining
  features were that they were significantly faster than walking, had greater
  carrying capacity than horse-drawn carriages, and cost less than carriage
  rides. They saved time and money. Unlike cars, trains were public
  transportation and didn't offer door-to-door service.
</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Three Driving Forces</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The main drivers behind people's move to the suburbs can be summarized into
  three points. First, the pursuit of a more elegant environment and
  <strong>larger houses</strong>. Second, the <strong>lower</strong> cost of
  suburban <strong>rents </strong>or real estate prices. Third,
  <strong>affordable ticket </strong>prices for transportation. Let's discuss
  these in more detail.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  <strong>Firstly</strong>, humans have a desire towards a more natural
  environment. Before the 19th century, the drinking water and public sanitation
  systems in large cities were relatively poor. Medical facilities were
  underdeveloped, and various epidemics were prevalent. Fire hazards were also a
  significant concern. The history of the Black Death is well known, but similar
  events occurred worldwide. In the late Eastern Han Dynasty, for instance, five
  of the famous Seven Scholars of Jian'an died in a plague in the city of Ye in
  that very year. Living in low-density suburbs still aligned with people's
  pursuit of health and safety, at least a hundred years ago.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  <strong>Secondly</strong>, suburban land was more affordable. In the early
  20th century, trains were approximately five times faster than walking,
  roughly expanding the diameter of cities by a factor of five. Around the same
  time, train lines in New York extended up to 15 kilometers from the city
  center. Even medium-sized cities like Washington saw train lines extending
  seven to eight kilometers. The area available for suburban development
  increased by over 20 times. Previously, these suburban lands consisted of
  villages and farmland, making them quite inexpensive. Even with some price
  increases, they remained much more affordable than city centers. People had a
  much broader range of choices for building houses and could afford larger
  plots of land. Dreams of low-density living with large gardens that were
  impossible in the city became achievable in the era of trains. In that period,
  an average-income family had residential land in the city of approximately
  80-150 square meters with a building area of 80-150 square meters. In the
  suburbs, plots were roughly 300 square meters to 1000 square meters each, and
  house sizes often exceeded 200 square meters. Gardens and roads occupied a
  significant proportion of the surrounding area. Traditional urban areas had a
  gross floor area ratio of approximately 1.0, while new suburbs had a gross
  floor area ratio of approximately 0.2-0.5. In other words, the density of
  buildings in suburbs was equivalent to about one-fourth to one-half that of
  traditional urban areas.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  <strong>Lastly</strong>, train ticket prices gradually became affordable.
  Currently, subway fares in China generally range from 3 to 10 yuan, which is
  relatively affordable. However, this is due to government subsidies. The
  actual cost of riding is two to three times higher than the ticket price. In
  the early 1900s, trains were generally operated as market-driven services.
  Around 1900, train tickets in major cities worldwide cost between 2 cents and
  1 cent, relative to the silver currency commonly used at that time. Most
  countries used silver coins weighing around 24-27 grams, including the US
  dollar, Mexican peso, Chinese Republic's "Yuan Datou," Canadian dollar, and
  Hong Kong dollar. This made price comparisons relatively straightforward.
  Monthly tickets ranged from 5 silver dollars to 8 silver dollars, equivalent
  to about $85 to $140 in today's US dollars. Currently, New York City's subway
  monthly pass costs $110, equivalent to 7 US dollars in 1900 (adjusted for
  inflation). This shows that the ticket prices in developed countries have
  remained relatively stable. Clearly, this was not cheap for Third World
  countries. In the early years of the Republic of China, the average monthly
  salary for white-collar workers in Shanghai was around 30 to 50 yuan, which
  was on the edge of being able to afford train tickets. Most people earned less
  than this. It's well known that in 1918, our great leader earned only 7 silver
  dollars per month while working as a librarian in Beijing, making daily train
  rides a challenge. Therefore, in the early 20th century, trains were a
  phenomenon primarily associated with the middle class, especially in East
  Asia. Train-induced suburbanization was not particularly evident.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  What were the monthly incomes of urban workers in the United States at that
  time? Around 1900, middle-class white-collar workers earned approximately
  $60-80 per month. Ordinary laborers or female workers earned only about $15
  per month. So, even in the United Kingdom and the United States, train-induced
  suburbanization was primarily a middle-class phenomenon. That's why the
  suburbs were called "garden suburbs" at the time. In London, this was
  reflected in the western suburbs like Hempstead, while in New York, it was
  evident in areas like Forest Hills in Queens. These were all residential areas
  for the middle class and above. However, in the early 20th century, income
  levels increased rapidly in the United Kingdom and the United States. By 1918,
  even the monthly wages of ordinary blue-collar workers had reached $100,
  meaning that trains had become accessible to the masses. Spending 10% of
  income on transportation was not too much, especially if housing expenses were
  reduced by moving to the suburbs. Therefore, the process of train-induced
  suburbanization, from being a phenomenon of the middle class to becoming
  accessible to the general population, was relatively short-lived.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Furthermore, once the train-induced suburbanization model became accessible to
  the general population, it addressed not only the issues of improvement and
  cost savings but also led to an overall reduction in the cost of living. Young
  people who had just started working in the city, where rents were high, could
  opt to live in the suburbs. Although they needed to buy train tickets, the
  money saved on suburban rents often resulted in a surplus. Therefore, the
  suburbs played a significant role in solving housing problems for migrant
  workers and facilitating rapid urbanization. This phenomenon is evident in
  areas around New York, such as New Jersey, Queens, and the Bronx, in Tokyo
  with places like Nakano, Mitaka City, and Setagaya, in Beijing with areas like
  Tiantongyuan, Huilongguan, and Tongzhou, and in Hong Kong with districts like
  Sha Tin and Tsuen Wan. Of course, there are many nuances and interesting
  observations in the details of each of these suburban areas.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Suburban Patterns</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  It's important to emphasize that train-induced suburbanization is
  significantly less intense than car-induced suburbanization, and it's not the
  same as what we see in today's suburbs. train stations and tracks occupy
  relatively small spaces. Therefore, the layout of train suburbs closely
  resembles a low-density extension of traditional urban areas, as I mentioned
  earlier. It can achieve a population density of 5,000 to 10,000 people per
  square kilometer. This mechanism easily increases density and creates a
  pattern that resembles traditional urban areas. Initially, it was the middle
  class building large houses in the suburbs.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  As train efficiency improved and ticket prices decreased, the working-class
  joined the suburban dream. They chose less expensive locations or smaller
  houses, forming a mosaic of communities alongside the upper-middle class.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  These garden suburbs typically extended about one kilometer from the train
  stations. Small commercial areas developed around the train stations. Train
  lines typically radiated out from the edges of the old city centers, extending
  in a radial pattern. The garden suburbs wrapped around these train lines,
  shaping the city's development pattern into the form of a hand. The
  traditional urban area resembled the palm of the hand, while the garden
  suburbs extended like fingers, and the small commercial areas near the train
  stations were like the joints of the fingers.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  These joints, which are what we now call TOD (Transit-Oriented Development),
  although they weren't referred to as such back then, harbored many urban
  economic phenomena. Its most developed manifestation can be seen in Tokyo.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Culture</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Trains or subway systems form vast and intricate machinery systems in cities.
  They are the arteries of the economy, yet they can be grand, even mysterious,
  and labyrinthine in appearance. They can be iconic and objects of admiration.
  The daily movement of millions of people within this group can even take on a
  ritualistic quality. Furthermore, this movement often appears highly
  organized.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  It's remarkable that ancestors who were once innocent and carefree
  hunter-gatherers could collectively navigate a labyrinthine subway network
  with complex signaling systems. This seems to be a testament to the profound
  adaptability of human nature.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Trains have become significant symbols of urban culture, embodying certain
  lifestyles and attitudes. The train system was initially a phenomenon of urban
  mechanization, a step up in social constraints, and the individualization of
  personal space. It became a material carrier of urban collectivism and
  community worship. Participation in the public transportation system signified
  acceptance of a somewhat alienated lifestyle.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  This can be seen as an ideology embracing the future, embracing more complex
  constraints.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  It can even carry a sense of moral superiority, enough to differentiate
  between groups. The same route may be taken by an office worker who knows it
  like the back of their hand, and a stranger, but they may never form a
  societal bond. In other words, people who are face-to-face with you may not
  actually exert any real constraint on you. Is this not freedom under
  constraint?
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In summary:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Firstly, train technology matured, expanding the commutable diameter of cities
  by about five times. This led to the emergence of mega-cities. Using a
  biological analogy, efficient circulation systems and enhanced oxygen
  transport capacity inevitably lead to the evolution of larger organisms, which
  also develop new characteristics.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  These transportation systems significantly increased the amount of land
  available for development and lowered land prices. Initially, they addressed
  the issues of improving housing environments and creating suburban gardens.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Then, when the monthly income of the average worker reached a certain level,
  around the time of World War I in the UK and the US, trains in the suburbs
  became a worker-friendly lifestyle choice. This helped fuel rapid population
  growth in major cities.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Trains drove suburban development in a finger-like pattern. Their density was
  not particularly low, resembling traditional downtown areas.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  However, soon, while trains were still trying to expand their market share in
  some cities, in other places, they lost ground to cars. Cars became dominant
  in most economically developed regions. Nonetheless, trains demonstrated
  remarkable vitality in specific areas of very large cities.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>这期我们讨论一下城市的郊区化现象。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在城市学专业领域，郊区化是一个大题目。为什么？从今天看，郊区的面积早已远远超过城区，以美国为例，他超过一半的人口居住于郊区，比住城区和乡村加起来都多。所以今天毋宁说是一个郊区的时代。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  什么是郊区化？..<br />十九世纪之前的城市很小，一般直径1-2公里，帝都级别的，君士坦丁堡和元大都，直径也就5-6公里。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  他们城区人口和建筑的密度比较高。每平方公里5000-50000之间。而城外就是农村，人口和建筑的密度非常低。两者相差十倍以上。视觉上可以截然分开。而，十九世纪之后，特别是现在，城市很大，直径动不动30-50公里。在密度很高的城区周边，有一些密度不高不低，介于城区和乡村之间的区域。这就是郊区。Suburb，这个词来自拉丁文。也就是亚城区、或者叫次级的城区。郊区化，就是这种次级的城区快速扩张的过程。&nbsp;
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>简单粗暴的说，有前后相继的两大波交通技术推动了这种郊区化。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  第一波，是19世纪开始的有轨电车之类的公共交通工具，在发达国家普及的时
  间点在1900年前后。现在仍然在以地铁、轻轨等形式在全世界发展。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  第二波，是20世纪普及的小汽车和公路网的建设。普及的高峰是在二战之后，今天在发展中国家正经历普及的高峰，所以他的高峰还没过去。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  第一波，电车、
  地铁所导致的郊区化，其密度相对第二波，汽车带来的郊区化要高一些。所以，在今天，电车甚至不被专业人员当成一种郊区化的因素，而被当成郊区重新城市化的因素。被专业人员眼里，电车、地铁的形象是正面的。而小汽车郊区的形象是负面的。特别在碳达峰、碳中和的背景下。更是如此。多数专家都不认为在第三世界普及小汽车是环境上可行的。但是，我们要直面一个事实。那就是：第二波小汽车对郊区化的推动的烈度远远超过第一波。城市范围的扩大，突出了小汽车的优势，加剧了市场对小汽车的依赖性，形成正反馈，愈演愈烈。而且，在未来，我认为它的份额不可能让位给公交系统，但是，会让位给共享小汽车系统，特别是自动驾驶的车辆系统。我在37期讨论过这个问题。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>我下面继续对历史的讨论。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  我们之前讲过几个概念，在19世纪之前，绝大多数人步行的时代。人的移动速度是每分钟80米；传统城市就是构建在这种交通模式上的。传统城市的一般尺寸，大概分三个等级，
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol>
  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    直径1-2公里的，是普通城市，人口几千人到一两万人；人去城里的绝大多数地方，走路15分钟之内；古代、中古时代的绝大多数城市属于此类。
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    直径两三公里，已
    经属于大城市了，人口几万到十几万；人去城里的绝大多数地方，走路半小时之内；乌鲁克、佛罗伦萨、威尼斯属于此类。
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    直径5公里左右，属于帝都级别了，这样的大城市在现代之前并不常见。人口可以达到几十万，上百万；人去城里的绝大多数地方，走路1小时之内；4世纪的罗马、7世纪的长安、君士坦丁堡、18世纪的江户、13世纪的杭州、14世纪的元大都属于此类。这种规模的城市人口，大大超过了周围农业区可以供给粮食的极限；他们依赖于大量外来的食物输入，也就意味着它作为帝都充当着非常广阔的地区的统治枢纽。
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这些，就是郊区化之前的传统城市。它们的边界都很清晰，城里城外一目了然。城门外面有一个小小的商业性质的关厢社区，它的外面就是相当均质的乡村，那里有少量别墅和农庄，大量的田野、牧场和林地。有钱人有条件住郊区别墅。路易十四日常住在巴黎郊区凡尔赛宫，相当于他的别墅，但是他基本不去巴黎。当时的贵族住在郊外是以日常不在城市里面工作为前提的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  直到，电车出现，城市人才可能晚上住在郊区，白天进城工作。然后郊区和市区的边界开始变得模糊。这就是所谓郊区化的开始。<br />这里说的电车，指代了一系列交通工具。包括更早的马拉的有轨道的车厢，英文一般叫tram或者trolley；蒸汽机或者内燃机牵引的缆车，车不带动力，靠一根绳子拖着在轨道上走，英文一般叫cableway；然后就是和我们今天理解的有轨电车比较类似的车辆。还包括后来的各种公共汽车、地铁和轻轨，是它们的后继者。效率在不断提升，他们的作用没有发生质的改变。所以，我们把这些交通工具看做一类来讨论。它们的特点是，速度比走路快若干倍、运载能力大于马车、成本低于马车。更省时间、更省钱。有别于小汽车，电车是一种公共交通工具，不提供门到门的服务。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

  推动人们移居郊区的主要动力有三点，第一，追求更优雅的环境，更大的房子。第二，郊区租金或者房价低；第三，车票要够便宜。下面展开讨论一下。<br />首先，人有喜欢自然的天生倾向。在19世纪之前，大城市的饮用水卫生和公共卫生系统是比较糟糕的。医疗不发达，各种流行病非常严重。火灾问题也比较严重。黑死病的历史广为人知，其实一样的事在全世界都有，东汉末年的文学人物，建安七子之中，有五人死于建安二十二年，其中四人有明确记载，死于当年邺城的瘟疫。所以，生活在低密度的郊区，至少在一百多年前，仍然符合人们对健康和安全的追求。<br />第二，郊区的土地便宜。20世纪初的电车的速度大约是人走路的五倍，我们粗略的算城市的直径增加到原来的5倍。20世纪初，纽约的电车线路延伸到距离市中心15公里的距离上。华盛顿这种中型城市，电车线也延伸到了七八公里之外。能够用于郊区开发的面积，大约增加了20倍以上。从原来七八个平方公里，扩大到上百平方公里的巨大的可开发的区域。土地的供求关系骤变。这些郊区土地原来是村庄和农田，很便宜的，现在即便价格有所增加，仍然比市中心便宜得多。人们盖房子可以选择的范围大大扩展，也可以买得起更大的地块。从前，在市区不能实现的低密度，有大花园的梦想，在电车时代突然成为可能。当时，一个中等收入人家，城区的住宅土地，大约80-150平方米之间，建筑面积在80-150平方米之间。而在郊区大约300平方米到1000平方米一个地块。房子的面积经常达到200平米以上。附近园林和道路占比很大。传统市区的毛容积率大概在1.0左右，而新郊区的毛容积率大概0.2-0.5左右。也就是说，它的建筑物的密度，相当于传统市区的四分之一到一半的样子。&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />第三，车票价格逐渐亲民。现在中国的地铁票价一般3元-10元之间，还是比较亲民的。但是，这是在享受政府补贴的。乘车真正的成本，比票价高两三遍。过去，电车在全世界范围，一般是市场化运营的，在1900年前后，全世界主要大城市的电车车票，根据你坐几站，票价大概在2分钱到一毛钱之间。这个分，是相对于当时常用的银元价格。当时多数国家都使用24-27克重上下的银币，包括美元、墨西哥元、中华民国袁大头、加拿大元、港币等，比较容易比较物价。月票的价格在5个银元到8个银元之间。
  也就是说月票的价格相当于现在85-140美元。现在纽约的地铁月票价格还是110美元，相当于1900年的7个美元（当时是银元）。所以，你可以看出来，发达国家车票的价格是相当稳定的。显然，这个对于第三世界来说，并不便宜。中华民国初年上海的普通白领月薪大概三五十元。属于能支付得起车票的边缘。而当时多数人的收入在此之下。大家知道，1918年，伟大领袖在北京做图书管理员的时候，一个月的工资，也就七块银元，天天做电车是很困难的。所以，二十世纪初，电车在，在东亚是一个纯粹的中产现象。电车郊区化基本没有明显的发育。当时美国城市职工的月薪是多少？1900年前后，中产白领大概60-80美元。普通劳工、或者女工的月工资，可能只有15美元左右。所以说，当时，即便在英美，电车郊区也是一个中产现象。所以当时的郊区叫做”花园郊区“。在伦敦，体现为西郊的Hempstead，在纽约体现为皇后区的forest
  hill。这些都是中产以上的住宅区。但是，20世纪初，英美国收入水平提高很快。到1918年，普通蓝领的月工资也达到了100美元。意味着电车彻底的平民化。10%的收入用于交通开支，是不多的。而且，如果他的住房开支还能因为搬到郊区有所缩减。所以，电车郊区，从中产化，到平民化，这个过程非常短促。

<p>
  而且，电车郊区这种模式，一旦平民化之后。他解决的就不仅仅是改善和省钱的问题，而是整体降低了生活成本。刚刚进城工作的年轻人，市区房租贵，可以住郊区。虽然需要买车票，但是，郊区房租省的钱更多，还有结余。所以，郊区对于解决进程打工人员住房问题，实现快速城市化，就有了很强的推动力。这在纽约附近体现为新泽西、皇后区、布朗克斯，在东京体现为中野、三鹰市、世田谷。在北京体现为天通苑、回龙观、通州。在香港体现为沙田、荃湾。当然，他们在细节上有体现出很多层次的差异，有很多有趣的，值得观察的现象。

  我需要强调一下，电车推动的郊区化比汽车推动的郊区化烈度小的多。和我们今天看到的郊区化不是一种东西。车的车站、铁轨，占据的空间不大。因此电车郊区的格局，很像传统市区的一种低密度的延伸，如我上文所说，能够达到传统市区密度的1/4到一半，每平方公里的人口密度，仍然可以在5000-10000人的水平。这种机理非常容易增加密度而和传统市区呈现相似的状态。最开始是中产阶级在郊区盖起大房子。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  随着电车效率的提高，票价的降低。下中产的工薪阶层也加入了美好的郊区。他们选择比较便宜的地段，或者比较小的房子，和上中产的社区形成马赛克状的镶嵌。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这些花园郊区，一般在电车站附近一公里展开。在电车的车站附近，形成一些小商业区。电车的线路一般从老市区的边缘出发，放射状延伸，花园郊区包裹这线路的形状发展
  ，把城市的发展图案变成手的形状。传统市区如同手掌，花园郊区如同手指伸出，车站附近的小商业区如同手指的关节。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这些关节，这就是今天我们所说的TOD，只不过当时不是这样被称呼的。TOD之中蕴藏着很多城市经济现象。它最发达的地方就是东京。

  Culture
  电车或者说地铁的轨道网，构成一个庞大的机器系统。它主要是经济动脉。但是，它也是宏伟的，看起来甚至是神秘的；它像迷宫一样复杂。也可以具有纪念性，可以成为崇拜的对象。每天几百万人乘车的这个群体行动，看起来也可能有仪式感。何况，这个行动经常看起来秩序井然。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  祖先曾经作为天真烂漫的猎人的人类，居然能够成群的，在复杂的指示系统的引导下，在迷宫一样的地铁网里找到自己的路线。这似乎本身就是人性的深不见底的适应能力的一个明证。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  电车形成了重要的城市文化符号。隐含着一种或者若干种生活态度。电车系统本来是对城市机器化，是社会约束升级，个人细胞化的一种现象。是城市集体主义，城市社群主义崇拜的物质载体。对公共交通体系的参与，是这样一种有异化色彩的生活方式的认可。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>这何尝不是一种拥抱未来，拥抱更复杂的约束的意识形态。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>其中，甚至具有道德优越感，足以区分人群。同样一条路线，一个熟门熟路的社畜</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  大城市里，和一些陌生人天天同路，然而却不可能形成社会结合。换句话说，和你脸贴脸的人，不能够对你产生真正的约束。这是不是不自由下的自由。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>最后，我简单概括一下：</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  首先，电车技术成熟，把城市可通勤的直径扩大了大概5倍。导致了特大城市的出现。类比生物，有了高效的血液循环系统，更强的氧气输送能力，就能演化，而且必然演化出大型的动物。而且他们也会具备新的特征。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这些交通系统，极大的增加了可开发的土地，降低了土地价格。最开始，解决的是住房环境改善和郊区花园的问题。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  然后，在一般职工的月收入达到一定水平，在英美大概一战前后，电车郊区成为一种劳工友好的生活选择。帮助了大都市人口的高速增长。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  电车推动的郊区，是一种手指状的形态。他的密度，其实不太低。和传统市区比较接近。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  但是不久，也就是，当电车在一些城市还在试图扩大份额的时候，在其他的地方，它的份额被小汽车夺走了。小汽车在多数经济发达地区成为了霸主，但是，电车在特定场合下，在特大城市的特定区域，还体现着很强的生命力。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>通勤交通部门，人类的细胞化。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>在传统城市里，大家走路出门，几乎不花费交通费。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>电车，每月1000-2000；汽车贵2-3倍。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  我大胆预言，随着自动驾驶的共享车辆的普及，交通成本会继续降低。郊区化会更加剧烈。地铁系统将遭遇巨大挑战，逐渐成为城市的负担，甚至被淘汰。私人小汽车作为中高档消费品继续存在。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>疏密差距拉大。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>也就是说，交通费用，相当于职工收入的10%。而同时代</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>请大家注意一下交通费用占收入的比例，还有趋势。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>目前美国的家庭交通开支平均占总开支的16%，住房占33%。吃饭只占14%。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Commuting and transportation, in a sense, represent the cellularization of
  humanity.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In traditional cities, people mainly walked, incurring almost no
  transportation costs.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trams cost around 1000-2000 a month; cars are 2-3 times more expensive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  I boldly predict that with the proliferation of autonomous shared vehicles,
  transportation costs will continue to decrease, intensifying suburbanization.
  Subway systems will face significant challenges and may gradually become
  burdensome for cities, or even phased out. Private cars will continue to exist
  as luxury items.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  This will lead to a widening gap between densely populated urban areas and
  sparsely populated suburbs.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In other words, transportation expenses will account for around 10% of
  workers' incomes, while in the same era…
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Please pay attention to the proportion of transportation expenses relative to
  income and its trends.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Currently, in the United States, household transportation expenditures average
  16% of total expenditures, housing accounts for 33%, and food only 14%.
