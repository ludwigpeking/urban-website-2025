  Around World War II, the proliferation of automobiles intensified the process
  of suburbanization, becoming one of the most significant topics in
  contemporary urban planning. This subject has generated countless doctoral
  theses and remains an ever-evolving field of study.
</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I will outline the discussion as follows:</p>

  <li>
    The unprecedented power of automobiles as a mode of transportation greatly
    enhanced the mobility of both people and goods. Unlike the earlier emergence
    of railway systems, automobiles possessed a unique characteristic -
    unparalleled freedom and the ability to reach virtually all corners of a
    city. Consequently, they offered higher efficiency and had a more profound
    impact. As a result, automobiles fundamentally altered the dynamic
    characteristics of cities. If we were to draw an analogy with the animal
    kingdom, it would be akin to a species having its blood oxygen concentration
    increased tenfold and its blood flow speed accelerated tenfold, leading to
    its evolution into an entirely new species. Such a leap in capability allows
    it to enter uncharted resource territory, resulting in significant resource
    redundancy, enabling it to engage in actions that may go against short-term
    interests without punishment. It can accommodate many inefficient and
    alternative strategies that would be unsustainable in normal circumstances.
    This is analogous to the human species, which can accommodate various types,
    including the lazy, homebodies, mad scientists, and thinkers. It has room
    for those with mental and physical disabilities, exhibiting significant
    tolerance for diverse lifestyles. In contrast, the lifestyle options for our
    closest relatives, such as gorillas, are far more limited. Therefore,
    suburbanization driven by automobiles is a realm vastly different from
    traditional urbanization.

    The enormous resource consumption associated with suburbanization by
    automobiles is extremely costly. Initially, this model was confined to the
    United States and a few developed countries, considered an unsustainable
    development pattern. However, this pattern is now spreading to more
    economies, including China and India, both developing major nations.
    Consequently, it poses challenges to these countries and the global economy
    and ecological environment.
  </li>

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    The proliferation of automobiles can alter the form of business districts,
    siphoning vitality away from city centers. This phenomenon is currently
    unfolding in China, and many are still adjusting to it.
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    Although automobile-induced suburbanization has been criticized by
    mainstream Western academia, the underlying trend may not necessarily
    diminish. In a world characterized by peace and progress, suburbanization
    might even deepen in the future through technological advancements and
    become increasingly refined. Conversely, if we are facing a turbulent and
    declining world, the vulnerability of automobile-driven suburbs may become
    exposed, potentially leading to the collapse of urban economic ecosystems.

<p>Let's delve further into this discussion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Automobile's Early Proliferation in the United States</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The automobile first gained widespread popularity in the United States,
  primarily because of the country's wealth and early production of relatively
  affordable cars. In 1924, Ford manufactured two million Model-T cars, each
  selling for $260, equivalent to about two months' wages for American
  white-collar workers at the time. Consequently, suburbanization began in the
  United States earliest and reached its peak intensity there.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Changing Urban Dynamics with the Automobile</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Before the advent of cars, cities were measured by foot. However, with the
  arrival and widespread use of automobiles, spatial distance became less
  relevant. What does this mean? It means that with automobiles, one could
  effectively participate in urban economic activities even if they were 30
  kilometers away from the city center. The developable urban space expanded
  significantly, covering thousands of square kilometers. This resulted in a
  surplus of spatial resources. Building density typically remained below 0.3
  and often fell below 0.1. This shift allowed for the development of new,
  batch-built suburbs where houses looked different but were essentially the
  same. They were often spaced far apart, leading to a self-centered appearance.
  Not only residential areas but also office buildings and super shopping
  centers followed this pattern. The granularity of various construction
  activities became coarser.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Our common perception is that European traditional city centers are very
  refined, while American suburbs appear monotonous. However, this difference is
  largely a matter of scale. The United States also has finely crafted
  traditional city centers, although they tend to be smaller. Conversely,
  European cities, despite their larger, well-preserved historical centers,
  often have peripheral areas connected by highways that can resemble American
  suburbs. (I'd like to interject that the phenomenon of rough urban
  construction is not solely caused by cars but is also related to the rise of
  the global working class and the decline of feudal organizations in the 20th
  century.)
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Automobile Suburbanization around the World</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Around the world, the automobile made cities more rugged and straightforward.
  Designing roads for motor traffic engineering became more critical than city
  design and landscaping skills. However, this does not imply that the world
  regressed. Quite the opposite, the tremendous leap in capabilities brought
  about by cars created a surplus of resources. This led to a phase of
  development imbalance.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  To illustrate, think back to when you were in high school, and you received
  $100 in pocket money each month. You carefully spent every cent and found joy
  in it. Suddenly, one day, your mother won the lottery, and your monthly
  allowance became $10,000. Initially, like many overnight millionaires, you
  might spend extravagantly and irresponsibly. However, it doesn't mean your
  standard of living decreased. You would gradually learn to manage your
  expenses and become more sophisticated.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Suburbanization driven by automobiles is currently in a rough and rudimentary
  stage. In the future, it's highly likely to evolve into a more sophisticated
  form.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  However, this period of ruggedness will likely last a long time, and its
  impact will be profound. My earlier discussion is primarily based on developed
  countries. Nevertheless, societies with fewer resource surpluses have also
  been influenced by the car-centric model of Western countries. This influence
  has penetrated deeply into their consciousness and led to some distortions in
  their development processes.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Challenges Posed by the Car-Centric Suburban Model</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Let me explain some of the challenges brought to the world by the car-centric
  suburban model.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Firstly, let's consider that cars, in an absolute sense, are quite expensive.
  Taking data from the United States in 2017 as an example, the nation spent
  about $1.1 trillion on cars, which equates to an average of over $3,600 per
  person. This is roughly equivalent to the per capita GDP of Mongolia.This
  expenditure includes the cost of purchasing cars, maintenance, insurance,
  parking fees, fuel, and more. Interestingly, the cost of fuel was only around
  $290 billion, which is less than one-third of the total expenditure.In
  contrast, Americans spent only about $53 billion on all public transportation
  combined, excluding air travel.So, you can see the ratio here. The consumption
  related to private cars compared to public transportation is roughly 7:1.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In the United States, 26% of energy consumption occurs in the transportation
  sector. Furthermore, 40% of energy consumption is attributed to buildings.
  It's worth noting that a significant portion of this energy use comes from
  low-density buildings associated with the car-centric suburban model. Compared
  to traditional urban buildings, low-density structures have higher surface
  area heat loss and consume more energy in transporting utilities. (For
  instance, two single-story houses with 100 square meters each have a larger
  total roof area than a two-story house with 100 square meters on each floor.
  This results in higher energy consumption for heating and cooling, as well as
  increased demands on municipal utilities.)
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Therefore, one might assert that if we were to compress all the existing
  low-density suburbs into a traditional urban format, we could potentially save
  roughly one-third of the energy consumed in transportation and construction,
  which amounts to about 66% of the total energy consumption.
</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Land Consumption</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In terms of land consumption:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol>
  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    <strong>Road Area</strong>: The area occupied by a car while on the road
    depends on its speed and the following distance, typically ranging from 2 to
    4 seconds of travel distance. In slow-moving areas like city centers,
    following distances can be as short as 20 meters, while in moderate-speed
    situations, it can be around 50 meters. The width of a lane is typically 3-4
    meters. Consequently, the space occupied by each car on the road ranges from
    70 to 200 square meters. During peak hours, a significant proportion of
    vehicles are on the road simultaneously.
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    <strong>Parking Space Area</strong>: Each household typically has one
    parking space, offices have dedicated parking spaces, and commercial areas
    also allocate parking. This means that the parking space required for each
    car is equivalent to several parking spots, approximately 60 square meters.
    When considering both road and parking space, the land area occupied by each
    car is conservatively estimated to be over 100 square meters. Thus, land
    consumption related to cars is comparable to residential land use.
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Urban Form</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Car-centric suburbs initially featured a very uniform spread of detached
  houses, much like those seen in American TV shows such as "The Wonder Years,"
  "Desperate Housewives," or "Six Feet Under." These endless rows of houses
  could be found in places like New Jersey, Long Island, Northern Virginia,
  Maryland, and Southern California. This pattern could be considered the spread
  of the American dream's lifestyle. Of course, this pattern was not entirely
  without order. Typically, there were about 5 houses per acre, with each house
  having a floor area of just over 200 square meters. In areas closer to the
  city center, it might be slightly denser, approaching about 10 houses per
  acre, each with less than 200 square meters. In more remote areas, it could be
  very spacious, with only 1-2 houses per acre, each ranging from 400 to 500
  square meters. However, the differences were not more than an order of
  magnitude; they were quite similar.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  This uniformity, from the perspective of information theory, does not
  represent a higher level of order but rather a very low-level order, only
  slightly better than chaos. It represents the initial deployment of this
  pattern.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In terms of transportation structure, car-centric suburbs often had some roads
  that didn't connect to others, what's known as cul-de-sacs or dead ends. More
  commonly, there were ambiguous roads that seemed to be passable but often
  weren't. These are referred to as "connected but not efficient" roads. The
  road network in these areas is sometimes described as resembling spaghetti - a
  tangled mess of roads where you can't easily determine how many strands there
  are or which one leads where.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In other words, your house is typically situated on a road that leads only to
  your residential area. Unless someone intends to enter your neighborhood or
  has taken a wrong turn, they will never pass by your house. It's rare to see
  strangers in front of your house.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some might argue, "Isn't this normal? Isn't this a good thing?"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  It can be good, especially when viewed from a specific perspective and in
  particular circumstances. If you live in a stable middle-class world, there
  may not be much of a problem.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  This raises the fundamental characteristic of car-centric suburbs: high cost.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  I have firsthand experience of living in such communities. In these
  neighborhoods, you can barely walk to even a convenience store. To buy
  anything or meet anyone, you need a car. So, owning a car is essential. People
  without driver's licenses, like children, have incomplete human rights.
  Therefore, the barrier to entry in such communities is owning a car, as I
  mentioned earlier, costing around $300 per month. This is enough to exclude
  the poorest classes.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Hence, car-centric suburbs form a series of middle-class enclaves that achieve
  class segregation. The homogeneity of these communities precisely reflects the
  middle class's desire to live among their class peers.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Even beggars would not venture into these suburbs because the population is
  too sparse to extract any substantial resources from.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  So, those on the political left (referred to as "white left" here) who live in
  the suburbs might be seen as hypocritical or ill-suited. If you have the
  capability, you could choose to be neighbors with unmarried, teenage African
  American mothers and their children in the inner city after all.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Social Structure</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  This suburbanization has altered urban and social structures significantly.
  Prior to the 19th century, people lived in traditional city centers. Your
  neighbors were often your baker, your tailor who made your clothes, the
  carpenter who repaired your house, your child's teacher, and perhaps, your
  neighbor was your teacher, landlord, or someone you attended church with. Each
  person's home often served multiple purposes. The ground floor might be your
  shop, you lived on the second floor, and the attic might house your tenants,
  often young individuals or apprentices.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In contrast to traditional city centers, car-centric suburbs have created
  relatively homogenous communities. Perhaps dozens of adjacent houses are
  purely residential, devoid of shops or industrial facilities. These houses
  don't necessarily serve as destinations for one another. You may share your
  faith with some of your neighbors or be the parents of your children's
  schoolmates, but forming a close-knit community with direct commercial or
  extensive social interactions becomes challenging. In theory, you could live
  next to your neighbors without ever visiting their homes or getting to know
  them.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  These suburbs have contributed to the formation of modern nuclear families. I
  use the term "nuclear families" rather than "atomized individuals."
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The organic nature of society has undergone changes, if not necessarily
  declines. People enter industry sectors when they go to work and residential
  sectors when they return home. These two sectors have become disconnected.
  Consequently, compared to traditional society, people's dependence on these
  two sectors has decreased. This has led to greater fluidity and a pursuit of
  universality in individual lives.
</p>

  In the next segment, I will discuss the unique characteristics of
  suburbanization in China and some features of suburban commercial districts.

<p>——————————————</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  第二次世界大战前后，由于汽车的普及，郊区化进程加剧。这是当代城市规划最大的课题，写多少篇博士论文也是没有尽头的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>我提纲式的讨论一下：</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  1）汽车这种交通工具前所未有的强大，极大的提高了人和货物的移动能力。比之前出现的铁路系统，它的特点是更自由，能够到达城市几乎所有的末梢。所以效率更高，影响更深。因此，汽车也极大的改变了城市的动力学特征。如果用动物做类比，相当于一种动物的血氧浓度增大10倍，血流速度加快10倍，那么它肯定演化成为另一个物种。它的能力飞跃如此之大，以至于它会进入资源的蓝海，会产生很大的资源冗余，以至于做一些违背短期利益的事情而不受惩罚。它可以容得下很多在正常情况下不能生存的低效策略和替代性策略。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  就好像，人类里面可以容得下各种懒人、宅男、科学怪人、思想家；精神障碍和残障人士也有相当的生存空间；人类生存方式的宽容度很大。；而人类的表亲大猩猩的生存方式就没有这么多样。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>所以，汽车造就的郊区化是一个和传统城市非常不同的天地。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  2）汽车郊区消耗的资源巨大，非常昂贵，开始只属于美国和少数发达国家，被认为是一种不可持续的发展模式。现在，这种模式向更多的经济体扩散。正在普及到中国、印度这些发展中大国。也因此，对这些国家和全球经济和生态环境都具有挑战性。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  3）汽车普及会改变商圈的形态，挖空市中心活力，这种情况在中国正在发生，但是很多人还没有适应。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  4）虽然，汽车郊区这个现象被西方主流学术界所批判。但是，它代表的趋势不一定会衰退，如果我们将要面对的是一个和平和进步的世界，那么郊区化反而在未来的技术更新中会加深，并且逐渐变得精致。如果我们会面对一个动荡和衰退的世界，汽车郊区的脆弱性可能会暴露出来，可能导致城市经济生态的崩溃。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>下面稍微展开。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  汽车首先在美国普及，因为美国最有钱，而且最早造出了相对便宜的汽车。1924年，福特生产了192万辆Model-T，每辆卖260美元。相当于当时美国白领两个月工资。所以郊区化在美国发展最早，烈度最大。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在汽车出现之前，城市是用脚步丈量的。汽车出现和普及之后，空间和距离变得无关紧要。什么意思？因为有了汽车，离开市中心30公里的地方，仍然可以有效参与城市经济活动。城市可开发的空间变得很大，可以达到几千个平方公里。空间资源一下子出现了很大的剩余。容积率一般在0.3以下，经常不到0.1。不需要从前在市区螺蛳壳里做道场的，市区的建筑，总是贴合着周围的道路和建筑，有着多变的轮廓形状。大楼一个个紧挨着，嵌套在一起，你要处理特别复杂的建筑空间上的关系，和隔壁各个业主之间博弈。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  现在，可以进行很傻瓜的成批开发。一英亩土地分成四份或者十份。每个上面，建一座看起来不一样，其实都一样的房子，这些房子彼此不相邻，都是很自我为中心的样子。不要说住宅都四仰八叉，看起来彼此无法分辨，似乎一个房子可以随便替换成另一个。甚至办公楼和超级购物中心，也是如此。各种建设行为的颗粒度变得很粗。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  我们印象中，欧洲的传统市区是多么精致，而美国郊区给人一种非常枯燥的观感。那其实是一个比例问题，美国也有精致的传统市区，只不过比例比较小，反过来，欧洲城市虽然有比较比较大的精致的传统市区，也有高速公路连接的外围区域，它们经常看起来和美国也没有什么区别。（我插一句，粗糙的城市建设现象不完全是汽车造成的，也和20世纪全世界的无产阶级崛起和封建组织衰落有关。）
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在全世界范围都类似，汽车让城市变得粗糙和简单。设计机动车道路的交通工程变得比城市设计和景观园林的技艺更重要。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  不要误会，并不是说世界倒退了。恰恰相反，汽车带来的巨大的能级提升，创造了大量的资源。导致了阶段性的发展失调。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  就好像，你中学的时候一个月有100块钱零花钱，你每一分钱都花的很仔细，而且也得到了快乐。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  突然有一天，你妈妈中了彩票，一个月给你10000块钱了，你最开始，和所有暴发户一样，不免表达失常，花的不是地方。但是不是说你的生活水平降低了。而且你会逐渐学会花钱，变成一个精致Boy。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  汽车郊区，正在经历的就是一个很粗枝大叶的阶段，以后，它很可能还是会逐渐变得精致。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  但是，这个粗糙的时间特别久，影响非常深远。我刚才的讨论，都是基于发达国家的。但是，有些没有那么大资源剩余的社会，也受到西方国家汽车社会的影响，这种影响深入在观念里。导致在发展过程中做出了一些变形的动作。
</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>——————————————————————————————————————————</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>————————————————————————————</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>汽车郊区这种模式，给世界带来的挑战，我稍微解释一下。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>首先，我们看，汽车在绝对意义上是很贵的。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  以美国2017年的数据为例，它们全国花在小汽车上的钱是1.1万亿美元，核算每人平均3600多美元。这已经相当于蒙古国人均GDP了。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这里面包括买车、修车、保险、停车费、油钱等等。其实油钱才2900亿美元，不到三分之一。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>相比之下，美国人在所有公共交通工具上，除去飞机之后，总共才花了530亿美元。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>所以，大家可以看看这个比例。小汽车和公共交通的消耗是7比1。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>美国26%的能源消耗发生在交通上。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  此外，40%的能源消耗在建筑上。注意，这里面大比例的是汽车郊区模式下的低密度建筑，和传统市区的建筑相比，低密度建筑表面热消耗和市政管线输送的能耗都比较高。（两幢一层的100平米的房子，比一幢两层，每层100平米的房子，它的总的表面积要大，多了100平米的屋顶。也更消耗市政管线。）
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  所以，可以简单粗暴的说，如果把现有的所有的低密度郊区都压缩到传统市区的状态，运输和建筑总共消耗的66%的能源，能省去大概三分之一。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>————————————————</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>土地消耗</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  道路面积，一辆汽车在路上行驶，视其时速，间距，2秒-4秒的行驶距离。在市中心缓慢形式的地方，间距要20米；中速就是大概50米的间距。车道的宽度是3-4米；所以，每辆车上路，占据的面积是70-200平方米。高峰时段，相当大比例的车，都同时上路。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>形态</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  汽车郊区在形成之初呈现一种非常均制的独栋房屋的蔓延。和美剧成长的烦恼、或者绝望主妇、或者六英尺下的一样。无边无际，在新泽西、长岛、北弗吉尼亚、马里兰和南加州，都铺满这样的东西。可以把这认为是美国梦的生活方式的蔓延。当然，这种图案并非完全没有秩序，一般，每英亩5栋，每栋建筑面积200平米多点；在离市中心进的地方，会略微密集，趋近每英亩10栋，每栋200平米不到；而更幽深的地方，可能非常宽松，每英亩1-2栋，每栋400-500平米之大。然而，相差其实不超过一个数量级，大同而小异。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这种均质性，从信息论的角度，并非代表更高层次的秩序，而是一种很低级的秩序，只略微强于混沌。它代表了这种了这种模式的初级展开。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  从交通结构上，汽车郊区里面，有一些不是那么四通八达的结构。专业术语叫尽端路，俗称死胡同。更多的是处于暧昧的似通非通的道路。专业术语叫“通而不畅”。专家管这种道路网叫做，Spaghetti意大利面，这种面，你用叉子把它插起来一坨。但是你永远看不出来里面有几根，更看不出来那根是哪根。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  就是说，你家的房子，在一条通向你们小区专用的路上，别人除非是要进这个小区，或者走错了路，否则永远不会路过你家。你家门前常年见不到陌生人。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>有人可能说：这不是很正常吗？这不是很好吗？</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  是很好，而且，经常故意这样的。但是，那要看是对谁好，在什么情况下好。假如你生活在一个静止的中产阶级世界，这样其实没什么问题。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>这就涉及到汽车郊区的一个最基本特点，就是高成本。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  我是有住这种社区的一手经验的。在这种社区里，你基本无法走到任何一个哪怕是便利店。要买任何东西或者见任何人，都需要开车。所以人手一辆车是必备的。没有驾照的人，比如小孩，他的人权是不完整的。所以，要入住这种社区，你的门槛就是要杨一辆车。我上面说了，一个月300美元。这足以把最贫困阶级拒之门外。

  所以汽车郊区就是一个个中产阶级的国中国，实现了阶层隔离的功能。这种社区的均质，也恰恰反应了，中产阶级对和自己的阶级兄弟住在一起的要求。

  所以，住在郊区的白左很可能是虚伪、不称职的。有本事你和未婚先孕的十几岁单亲黑妈妈黑孩子做邻居，住到市区后街里面去。

  这种郊区化，改变了城市结构，也影响了社会结构。在19世纪之前，你住在传统市区。你的邻居经常是你的面包师傅、给你做衣服的裁缝、给你修房子的木匠、你孩子的老师、你可能是你邻居的师傅或者土地、是他们的牧师或者教友。每一个人的家可能都是多用途的。一层可能是你的商店，你住在二层，阁楼你住着你的房客，房客一般是年轻人或者学徒。

  和传统市区相对的，汽车郊区创造了一种相对单纯的社区。可能几十个相邻的房子都是住宅，没有商店、没有生产企业。这些房子彼此不构成目的地。你和你的一部分邻居之间，可能是教会的教友，或者是学校同学们的家长，但是，很难是互为主顾。或者形成更复杂的关系。理论上你可以永远不去任何一个邻居家，也不用和他们认识。

  社会的有机性，如果不是下降了。那么也发生了变化。人上班时进入行业板块，下班时进入居住板块。这两个板块脱离了。这样，和传统社会相比，人对这两个板块的依附性都降低了。成为了一种流动性更强，也更追求通用性的个人。
