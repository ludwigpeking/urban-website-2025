<p>
  Major cities in China are swiftly transitioning into the automotive suburban
  era. However, many professionals in the field have yet to grasp the
  intricacies of this transformation. In this edition, I invite you to explore
  the United States, with its century-long history of automotive evolution,
  specifically focusing on the landscape of shopping malls. Many patterns we
  observe are universally applicable, underscoring the global nature of certain
  phenomena. At the heart of my exploration lies the concept that shopping
  centers in the car era are fundamentally designed around automotive transport,
  distinguishing them from traditional urban commercial districts.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, a brief digression first.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The term for shopping centers in English is "Shopping Mall" or "Shopping
  Center."
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Originally, "Mall" referred to a grassy area where people would stroll and
  partake in games similar to croquet. It symbolized an open space for outdoor
  activities. For instance, the vast lawn situated between the White House and
  the Capitol in Washington D.C., where presidential inaugurations are held, is
  named the "National Mall" – essentially meaning "National Lawn" and certainly
  not implying a national shopping center. The green space in downtown Cleveland
  is also referred to as "the Mall," and humorously, in a particular source, it
  was mistakenly translated to "shopping center." A minor amusing note on the
  side.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Such "Mall" green spaces often hosted market fairs during holidays, bustling
  with stalls selling various items and entertainment activities, emanating a
  natural, cheerful, and lively ambiance.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Therefore, when Americans began using the term "mall" to denote suburban
  shopping centers, it was a clever and evocative choice of branding. The
  contemporary shopping mall encapsulates this essence—a vast sheltered space,
  perpetually spring-like, linking numerous stores, with people bustling about.
  This is the archetype embodied by shopping centers like Wanda Plaza.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  However, let's not get entrenched in one view. We face three pertinent
  questions: Firstly, in the US, where most shoppers arrive by car, why compel
  them to walk through such communal spaces when they could drive directly to
  their desired store? Secondly, wouldn’t it be more effective to have store
  fronts visible directly from the highways, instead of tucked inside malls? And
  thirdly, wouldn’t forgoing the construction and maintenance of this
  ever-spring communal space be a cost-saving measure without causing any harm?
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In reality, while the classic Wanda Plaza-style shopping centers do exist in
  the US, a more prevalent version is the following:
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Adjacent to highways is a rectangular parking lot, accommodating anywhere from
  dozens to thousands of vehicles. Lining the parking lot is a continuous strip
  of conspicuous stores, big and small, predominantly franchises—very grounded
  and relatable. In English, this type of shopping center is termed a "strip
  mall." Surprisingly, there's no direct Chinese translation for this term. A
  whimsical attempt using Google Translate amusingly rendered it as "strip dance
  shopping center." A word of caution: when in the US, don’t let such
  translations mislead you into misguided explorations. "Strip mall" literally
  and figuratively means a "linear shopping center."
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  As reported by the New York Times' Kramer, Andrew E., in 2013, the US had a
  total of 65,840 strip malls.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  One can only imagine the numerous developments and evolutions based on this
  archetype. It truly stands as the mother of shopping centers in the automotive
  age.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  1) The fundamental components of suburban malls in the automobile era are the
  shopping center and parking spaces. The shopping center usually occupies about
  40% of the land, while parking and driveways consume 60%.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Typically, these shopping centers are just one story tall. Why not build them
  with two stories? Because it's simply not worth the additional cost.
  Constructing two floors might have similar costs per square foot as one floor,
  but the revenue or rent from the second floor would be much lower.
  Furthermore, with a single-story design, you can achieve over 90% utilization
  of the floor space. Add another story, and you'll need elevators and
  staircases, dropping that utilization below 80%. Therefore, from a return on
  investment perspective, it's best to stick to a single story when working
  within a limited budget.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Then comes the parking lot. The area it occupies is usually slightly larger
  than the shopping center's built-up area. This may sound excessive, but for
  suburban malls, the key is to have convenient parking. Within the city,
  several similar malls are just a short drive away, sometimes less than 10
  minutes. If parking isn't easy at your mall, customers will simply go
  elsewhere. These vast parking spaces aren't only for everyday use; they're
  primarily designed for weekend peaks. On holidays, these lots might be 95%
  full. On weekdays, if 40% is occupied, that's a good day, with many spaces
  empty. Is that wasteful? Not at all. If you can't accommodate the rush on peak
  days, you'll eventually lose that rush altogether. During peak mall times,
  assume 10 customers per 100 square meters—a moderate density. With every two
  customers typically arriving in one car and each car occupying 28 square
  meters, every 100 square meters of retail space demands 140 square meters for
  parking. This is the reality of the automotive age.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Of course, a few malls can evolve into high-density formats, expanding to
  include new stores, adding floors, and even incorporating office or
  residential buildings. These malls will develop over their once expansive
  parking lots, turning some into multi-story parking garages, increasing the
  overall site density. Hence, these vast parking areas serve as potential
  development zones for suburban malls, even if most never undergo this
  transformation.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  2) The location for automotive suburban shopping centers must be at major road
  intersections. These roads offer 1) Accessibility and 2) Visibility. Both are
  self-explanatory, so there's no need for further elaboration.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Typically, these malls are near exits where two or three highways intersect.
  Their value doesn't primarily depend on their proximity to the city center but
  on the volume of traffic on the main roads. Taking IKEA in Beijing as an
  example: the first location is at the intersection of the North Third Ring and
  the Beijing-Tibet Expressway. The second is near the intersection of the
  Northeast Fourth Ring and the Airport Expressway, not far from the
  Beijing-Chengde Expressway. As you can observe, each location is at the
  intersection of two major traffic arteries. Moreover, they are gradually
  moving outward because ring roads offer faster mobility than crossing the
  city, potentially attracting a larger, more dense population.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Washington D.C.'s Beltway 495 is roughly the size of Beijing's Fifth Ring.
  Most of D.C.'s large suburban businesses are scattered along it.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Using the Average Daily Traffic (ADT), I broadly categorize roads into three
  levels: major arterials with around 100,000 vehicles, primary roads with about
  30,000, and secondary roads with roughly 10,000. These roads intersect in
  various combinations, each corresponding to a type of suburban mall, with
  deviations within half an order of magnitude.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The largest intersections, formed by two major arterial roads, can be found in
  first-tier cities with perhaps a dozen instances. In second-tier cities, there
  might be just a few, while in third-tier cities, there might be one or even
  none at all. Such intersections are prime locations for expansive shopping
  centers that span over 80,000 square meters and can be categorized as
  super-regional hubs.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    The second category is the intersection of a major arterial road and a
    standard main road. These types of intersections are particularly abundant
    in first-tier cities. In contrast, they're relatively rare and therefore
    more valuable in second-tier cities, which might use such locations to
    establish integrated regional shopping centers ranging between 40,000 and
    80,000 square meters. In first-tier cities, these intersections may not have
    as distinct an advantage. Instead, they could serve niche markets with
    specialized shopping centers that house flagship stores of big brands like
    Walmart and Metro, or even power centers and factory outlets. These could
    also be thematic or industry-segregated commercial clusters.
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    The third category is the confluence of a major arterial road with a
    secondary main road. In metropolises, these are quite common and thus might
    not be deemed as crucial, often overshadowed by larger intersections nearby,
    making their prominence relatively minor.
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    Next, we have intersections of two standard main roads, both witnessing
    daily traffic around the 30,000 mark. In large cities, these locations
    typically host sub-regional commercial hubs, suitable for commercial spaces
    between 10,000 and 40,000 square meters that may offer a diverse mix of
    specialty shops. However, in cities below the third-tier, such intersections
    could be among the busiest, potentially serving as larger, city-wide
    shopping centers. I recall Ann Arbor in Michigan resonating with this
    scenario.
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    Descending a level, we have intersections between a standard main road and a
    minor main road. These typically host neighborhood business centers
    comprising supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, and
    restaurants. In the U.S., Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) locations,
    which Americans visit more frequently than places like IKEA, can also be key
    anchors in such settings.
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    At the smallest scale, intersections of two minor main roads in the U.S.
    generally give rise to convenience hubs under 2,500 square meters. These
    might include a mini-market, gas station, laundromat, a couple of small
    eateries, and a barbershop – arranged more casually.
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Collaborative Corners</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Since I've mentioned intersections, whether they are overpasses or at-grade
  intersections, there will always be four corners. In urban commercial
  districts, these corners often host several shopping malls, forming a
  symbiotic ensemble. However, in suburban areas dominated by cars,
  collaboration between these corners is typically weak. This is because the
  space is expansive with broad roads and often intricate cloverleaf
  interchanges. Walking from one corner to another can be tedious, especially
  when carrying a significant amount of shopping. Parking is also conveniently
  abundant. Thus, people would likely drive from Mall A on one corner to Mall B
  on another, even if it's a short distance. As I mentioned earlier, once you're
  behind the wheel, whether the destination is across the street or five
  kilometers away, the distinction diminishes. As a result, the four corners of
  a suburban intersection often sadly operate in isolation, with one corner
  potentially dominating the others.
</p>

<p>
  <strong
    >3) Evolutionary Directions and Differentiation Strategies for Suburban
    Shopping Centers</strong
  >
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The most fundamental and iconic is the symbiotic relationship between anchor
  stores and smaller retailers. An anchor store, typically drawing large crowds,
  can be a department store, a large supermarket, a big specialty shop, or a
  luxury outlet. A shopping center might have two to three of these. Nestled
  between them are many smaller shops. While anchor stores might occupy only 40%
  of the shopping center's total area, they could contribute to 60% of sales.
  Interestingly, their rent might only be 20% of the total. Essentially, anchor
  stores drive foot traffic for the smaller shops, while the smaller shops
  shoulder a greater rent burden. Anchor stores represent the dominant entities
  in this ecosystem, while the smaller shops play a nurturing role. This
  configuration can be considered a basic model.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Another format is the Power Center, characterized by a series of anchor stores
  lined up side by side. Shoppers can efficiently move from one store to
  another. This setup, a specialized form of the strip mall, emphasizes shopping
  efficiency and caters to non-personalized consumption, typically at mid to
  low-end price points. From another perspective, it showcases the diverse
  offerings and in-depth services within these chain anchor stores.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Furthermore, there's the upscale, refined direction. Given the gradual rise in
  Americans' living standards (excluding inflation, which doubles every 20
  years), commercial entities need to keep pace with the evolving demands of
  this increasingly affluent populace. Enhancing spatial quality and emphasizing
  experience become paramount.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Within this direction, two phenomenal forms emerge: First, the Lifestyle
  Center emphasizes outdoor space experiences and elevates the proportion of
  dining options. Second, the City Center, while literally translating to "urban
  core", aims to recapture the charm of historical downtowns. It's larger in
  scale, more diverse in its offerings, and often features multi-tiered spatial
  configurations, including squares, lawns, urban parks, and outdoor
  recreational facilities. These centers, leaning into the "experience", are
  more prevalent in warmer regions, though they exist in the north as well.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Lastly, there's a trend towards high-density, urban-like redevelopment.
  Multi-storied malls incorporate high-rise offices, parking structures, and
  even apartments. They often leverage the connectivity of subways or trams to
  reduce reliance on parking and optimize space usage. The end result resembles
  traditional urban environments.

  中国大城市已经加速进入汽车郊区时代了，但是很多从业者还没掌握相应的知识。我这期，带大家看一看有百年汽车时代发展史的美国——它的购物中心的概况。其中很多是符合一般规律的，对谁都一样。我给的核心概念是，汽车时代的购物中心是围绕着汽车交通的，和传统市区的商圈逻辑不一样。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>先说两句闲话。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>购物中心，英文叫Shopping Mall或者shopping center。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Mall这个词，最开始是说一块草地，打一种类似老年人门球类的游戏，大家走来走去。也就是一块户外活动的草坪。举例，美国首都华盛顿白宫和国会门前那一大片草坪，总统就职仪式上进行群众集会的那个地方，就叫做National
  Mall, 民族大草坪，但是显然不是民族购物中心。克利夫兰市中心的那个草坪也是叫the
  Mall，在某本专业书上就被翻译成购物中心。我顺便吐槽一下。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这种草坪Mall，在节假日的时候会有市集，摆摊位卖各种东西，还有娱乐活动。它传达的是一种亲近自然的、欢快的、热闹的气氛。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  所以，这个词被美国人用来做这种郊区购物中心的代称，可以说是非常巧妙和美好的推广用词了。也非常达意。一个现代的shopping
  mall，就是在一个大屋顶下，有一个公共的空间，四季如春，连接着很多的店铺。大家走来走去。这就是万达广场之类的经典的购物中心。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  但是，脑筋请不要僵化，我们现在面对三个问题：其一，在美国，几乎所有顾客都是开车来的，何必让大家进到这样一个公共空间里走来走去，能直接开车到它要去的那家店不好吗？其二，为什么把店铺的门脸都闷在购物中心里面，让大家从公路上能一目了然地看到这些店铺不是更好吗？现在是第三个问题，如果我不修这个四季如春的公共区域，省一笔钱，又造成不了什么损害，那不是更好吗？
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  所以，在现实中的美国，万达广场那种模式的经典购物中心，存在，但是，更常见的是另一个版本。长相如下：
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在公路旁，有一个长方形的停车场，可以容纳几十两到上千辆车不等。停车场边上有一大排商店，大大小小，标牌醒目，多数都是连锁店。特别接地气。这种购物中心，英文叫strip
  mall。但是我发现这个词在汉语里面居然没有对应的翻译。我用谷歌翻译试了试，翻译出来的居然是脱衣舞购物中心。我希望大家在美国的时候千万不要受这种翻译的误导而徒劳探索。strip
  mall, 它的字面意思和实际意思都是“细条状的购物中心”。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>根据纽约时报Kramer, Andrew E.，2013年，美国总共有65840个strip mall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  你可以想象，在这种类型之上，进行过多少的发展和演化。所以它才是汽车时代的购物中心之母。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  １）汽车时代郊区Mall的基本构成就是：商场和停车位。商场占四成的用地，停车场和车道占六成。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>商场是一般是一层的；为什么不做二层？因为犯不上。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  你修两层，单方成本和一层差不多，但是二层的租金或者销售额低的多。而且，你如果是一层，得房率90%以上；而一旦做到二层，你需要一堆楼梯电梯，得房率下降到80%以下。所以在有限预算的情况下，只建一层的投资收益最高。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  然后就是停车场，停车场的面积一般略大于商场的建筑面积。这个听起来挺吓人的。但是，郊区mall，你最关键的服务就是停车要方便。因为这个城市里有若干和你差不多的商场。相邻几公里，看着挺远，但是开车差不了10分钟。如果你没有停车位，人家就不来了。而且，这个停车位不是给日常准备的，而是针对周末高峰。节假日高峰，一般95%停满。平日，40%停满就算生意不错了，多数车位都空着。那不是浪费吗？不浪费。如果你不服务好节假日高峰的停车，你就不会再有高峰了。商场高峰时间，假设每100平米10个客人，密度算中等吧，每2个人开一辆车，每辆车的占地28平米，那么每100平米的商店面积，对应的停车位占地140平米。停车位比商场面积大，这就是汽车时代。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  当然，有少数的mall能发展成高密度的形态。增建新店，加高楼层。甚至出现办公楼和住宅楼。这就是郊区mall向综合体发展的情况。这种情况下，原来的停车场会被用来开发。这样停车位就更不够了，一部分平面停车场会被改造成多层的停车楼。逐渐发展成更高密度的形态。所以，广阔的停车场，其实就是郊区mall的储备用地。只不过多数都没有机会得到利用。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  2）
  汽车郊区购物中心位置选择，必须是在主路的交叉路口上。主路提供1）可达性；2）能见度。这两个概念一目了然，我就不展开了。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  经常是两三条高速路互通立交桥的出口附近。位置好不好，主要看主路的车流量，和城市商场不同，离市中心的远近到不是最关键的；&nbsp;我以北京的宜家为例：第一个宜家在北三环和京藏高速的东北角。第二个宜家在东北四环和机场高速的西北角，离京承高速也不到2公里。前两个没有地铁，第三个宜家在南五环和京开高速的西北角，是有地铁的。你可以看出，每一个地点都是在两条日通行量10万级的交通大动脉的交叉口上。而且，逐渐移动到外环。为什么？因为北京环形移动比穿城的移动要快，外环比内环能有效带动的区域可能更大，人口可能更多。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  华盛顿的环路495，和北京五环的尺寸基本相等。华盛顿都市圈的多数大型郊区商业几乎都是依托他分布的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  主路按平均日通行量（术语叫ADT）半个数量级一档，我简单粗暴的分成三个量级：最高一级，10万级的是大动脉级主干路；次级，3万级，是一般主干路；最次，一万级的算次主路。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这三种路彼此交错，形成6种交叉口组合，基本上每种能对应一种郊区mall的定位；误差不会超过小半个数量级。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    最大的，两条大动脉级主路的交叉，在一线城市可能有十几个；在二线城市最多几个；三线城市可能一个或者没有。这种位置属于全业态、多主题的8万平米以上，上不封顶的超区域级购物中心的选址；
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    第二级，大动脉和一般主路的交叉口；这种位置在一线城市特别多；在二线城市这样的路口会比较珍贵；所以在二线城市，这种位置，可能可以做综合型的区域级购物中心。4-8万㎡之间。在一线城市，这种路口的相对优势小一点。更有可能看准差别化的市场，做有一定特色的购物中心，比如多个大品牌主力店，比如沃尔玛、麦德龙、组合的power
    center，比如工厂折扣店outlets，或者有主题的，或者分行业的商业聚集。
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    第三级，大动脉和次要主路交会点，在大城市太多，所以不重要，很容易被临近更大的路口吸收。所以它的层级其实不高。
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    然后，一般主干路，两条日通行量都在3万左右的一般主干路交会，这种路口，在大城市，就是一个典型次区域级商业中心的位置，适合一个1万㎡到4万㎡之间的小而全商业，或者特色商业组合。但是，在三线以下城市，这种路口可能就是全市最大的路口了，反而有可能成为一个大一点的辐射全城的购物中心。我上学的城市密歇根州安娜堡就是这种情况。
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    在下一级，一般主干路和次级主干路的路口。这就是一个，邻里商业中心；超市，药店，银行，五金店、餐厅之类的组合。有可能有车管所，车管所在美国算一个目的地。美国人去车管所比宜家频繁。所以车管所也算一个主力店。

    最小一级，两条次主路的路口，在美国一般体现为2500㎡以下便利中心，小超市、加油站、洗衣房，一两家小餐厅，理发店的组合；比较随意。

<p>四角协作</p>

  既然我提到了路口，那么不管是立交还是平交，都会有四个街角。在市区商圈，一般这几个街角有几家商场，形成一个共生组合。但是，在汽车郊区，一般这几个街角之间的协作非常微弱。因为空间太广阔了，路很宽，经常有苜蓿叶状的立交桥。走过去太累了。&nbsp;毕竟你要买很多商品。而停车又太方便了。你从一个街角的mall
  A去另外一个街角的mall
  B，大概率也会开车过去。我之前说到过，一旦你登上车轮，这个目的地在街对面还是在五公里之外，差别没那么大。所以，我们看到，汽车郊区路口的四个街角，经常形成可悲的各自为战的情形，而且很可能形成一个街角独大的局面。

<p>3）郊区购物中心的几种演化方向和寻求差异的策略</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  最基础、最经典的是主力店和小店形成的共生关系。主力店，必须是人流特别大的店；一般是百货商场、大超市、大专业商店、大奢侈品点之类；在一个购物中心里面有两到三个。它们之间夹着更多的小店。主力店占整个购物中心的面积，可能只有40%，但是销售额可能占60%；它们付给地主的房租，可能只有20%。也就是说，它们负责给小店吸引客流，小店负责给主力店背房租。主力店是收割者的生态位，而小店是被孵化的生态位。这种组合，可以认为是基本型。

  另一种业态是Power
  Center，就是若干主力店一字排开。购物者直来直去。特别高效。他是strip
  mall的一种特化。强调购物效率，服务非个性化的消费。一般是中低档的。另外一个角度看，它体现了这些连锁主力店自身店铺内部的多样性和服务纵深的提高。

  此外，是高端化、士绅化：因为，美国人的生活水平也是逐渐提高的，排除通胀，每20年翻一番。所以，你商业要跟上这些越来越有钱的人的需求。要提高空间品质，强调体验。

  这个方向上，大概有两种现象化的形态：其一，lifestyle
  center生活方式中心；强调室外空间的体验；提高餐饮的占比。其二，city
  center，字面上是城市中心，其实是表达要找到老市区的调调的这样一种心愿。它的规模更大，业态更多元，经常有几个层次的空间组合的嵌套。甚至会做广场、草坪、城市公园、室外游艺项目。是景点化，微度假的购物中心。这些强调室外空间体验的项目，在温暖区域更加普遍，在北方略少，但是也是存在的。

  最后，就是高密度化，再城市化；多层的商场，引入高层办公、停车楼，甚至公寓；经常是借助地铁电车的接入。降低对停车位的依赖而实现空间的提效。最终形成类似传统市区的环境。
