<p>
  In this discussion on China's suburbanization, placing it in the context of
  American suburbanization makes sense due to their parallels, allowing for a
  direct comparison. American suburbanization often lacks a coherent top-down
  design, and its conceptual approach tends to be somewhat dispersed.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In China, suburbanization typically has a top-down character. It is influenced
  by officials and experts. These experts, significantly influenced by Utopian
  modernist architectural theories, handle urban land through a mindset aligned
  with the management of state-owned assets. They essentially serve as the
  brains behind this process.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  From the bottom-up perspective of China's suburbanization, the driving forces
  are developers and consumers. It's a blend of market-driven dynamics,
  traditional elements, and even ancient concepts. Influences from local
  folklore and feng shui theories can be discerned.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Such dichotomy between the top-down and bottom-up perspectives has inevitably
  led to a blending of the two, forming a unique discourse and following a
  distinctive logic. As a result, China's suburbanization manifests in ways that
  are quite unique and at times, internally inconsistent.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  To grasp the intricacies of China's urban development, it's essential to
  understand these varying perspectives and their origins.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chinese suburbanization has distinct features. Here are six key points:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  <strong
    >One, The primary intention of China's suburban development was to construct
    new cities. However, many aspects adopted typical suburban methods.</strong
  >
  For instance, wide streets, vast city blocks, low-density road networks, and
  green belts on either side of roads all mirror the pre-WWII Athens Charter
  techniques. These are more suited for suburbs than for vibrant urban
  economies. Placing green belts along streets provides a seemingly natural
  aesthetic, catering to a simple, unrefined urban image perception. Without
  delving too deep, such setups are not pedestrian-friendly, diluting street
  vibrancy, and hindering the integration of commercial hubs and fostering a
  vibrant urban ecology. This results in a uniquely Chinese urban sprawl with
  suburban features.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  <strong
    >Two, Areas like Pudong New District, Wangjing New Town, Hunnan New
    District, and many others represent the epitome of China's suburbanization.
    Not all these new districts are successful, but quite a few are.</strong
  >
  In some cases, property prices in these areas even surpass those in older
  districts, and vibrant new commercial centers emerge.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The outperformance of new districts over older ones is a phenomenon of
  late-mover advantage. Globally, success stories of new cities developed
  through intensive planning based on a single blueprint are rare, with more
  failures than successes. In China, while there are numerous unsuccessful
  examples, there are also commendable cases. As previously mentioned, good
  outcomes typically emerge from solutions aligning with both top-down and
  bottom-up perspectives.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  From the top perspective, in China, developing new cities often encounters
  fewer challenges in terms of coordination and displacement compared to
  revitalizing old cities. Consequently, it's usually more cost-effective and
  more visually impressive, tapping into areas with lower resistance and clear
  outcomes.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  From the bottom perspective, akin to the situation in the U.S., these new
  districts usually attract middle-class families, creating a "middle-class
  country within a country," meeting consumer demands. Furthermore, new areas
  often provide ample parking, a stark contrast to traditional districts. Thus,
  many middle-class populations migrate from the traditional centers to these
  new areas, leading to declining vibrancy in the old districts and sometimes
  even causing new commercial centers to overshadow traditional ones.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Developments in Chongqing's Jiangbei have diverted the buzz from traditional
  urban areas, and the population in Shenyang's Hunnan New District has
  similarly affected the city center.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  However, the supposed cost-effectiveness of these new districts comes with
  caveats. While initial costs might be lower, the long-term costs tend to be
  higher. These include the establishment of new transportation, commercial,
  medical, and educational systems, all of which must be organized from scratch
  without leveraging existing urban infrastructures. This puts a greater
  financial strain on local governments and elevates the actual user costs.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Still, in the backdrop of China's rapid economic growth and with local
  governments benefiting from land sales, these burdens might seem manageable.
  Yet, in economically stable developed countries, the success rate of such new
  city projects is much lower.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  <strong
    >Three, The transportation improvements behind Chinese suburbanization is a
    blend of car and public transport usage, leading to an increased reliance on
    automobiles.</strong
  >
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Following the construction of intercity highways, many second-tier cities have
  developed urban expressway systems over the past decade. This has
  significantly spurred the growth of suburbanization. While subway and bus
  systems have also expanded, the share and usage of private cars have surged at
  a much faster rate.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  China's car ownership approximately doubles every seven to eight years. In
  2021, the nationwide car ownership rate, including in rural areas, was roughly
  0.2 cars per person. This is about half of Japan's rate and a third of that in
  the U.S. However, when accounting for urbanization levels, car ownership in
  Chinese cities is closer to Japan's and approximately half of the U.S. rate.
  Yet, it's important to recognize that with every 50% increase in car
  ownership, you'll observe a significantly different urban ecosystem.
  Therefore, China is currently undergoing a dramatic transformation in its
  urban environment, advancing at a pace of about one major shift every three
  years. I estimate that from 2013 up to now has been the period of the highest
  growth rate for car-driven suburbanization. Traffic congestion has notably
  worsened in most cities, and a decline in traditional city centers is evident
  in many areas. As previously discussed, this trend towards increased car usage
  appears nearly unstoppable.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  <strong
    >Fourth, Chinese suburbanization is predominantly high-density,
    significantly denser than the car-centric suburbs in Western
    countries.</strong
  >
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Viewed from a grassroots perspective, this is driven by cost and market
  demand. Chinese land prices have been relatively high for over a decade. As a
  result, achieving a high floor area ratio to dilute land costs is crucial.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  From a top-down view, government officials, aiming to conserve land, have
  implemented policies that exclude developments with a density below 1.0.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Consequently, there's a set floor area ratio baseline for Chinese suburbs.
  Compared to the American-style car suburbs I discussed earlier, this ratio is
  many times higher.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Any urban planner would see this as an advantage. High-density promotes the
  incubation of commercial services and sustains efficient public transit
  routes. This high-density suburban model also offers some inclusivity for
  those who don't drive.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  High density means that local urban expressways face greater pressure, leading
  to rapid saturation of these roads. Secondary road networks must develop
  concurrently, resulting in an environment with more alternative routes. Given
  that high density can accommodate more people, the sprawl of Chinese suburbs
  covers a smaller area than its American counterparts, representing a more
  resource-efficient approach.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  <strong
    >Fifth, Chinese-style suburbs, although high-rise, have a topological
    relationship similar to the low-density suburbs in the U.S.: they are
    terminally developed.</strong
  >
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  What does "terminally developed" mean? It refers to many pocket-like spaces,
  or what we might call cul-de-sacs. Each residential area, in its layout, is
  essentially a pocket-shaped cul-de-sac, devoid of through traffic.
  Furthermore, each high-rise building, topologically, is also a cul-de-sac as
  all residents enter and exit through a single entrance.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  You might argue, "Isn't that obvious? Aren't all houses built this way?"
  Indeed, except for shopping malls, the vast majority of houses or rooms are
  designed this way. But in traditional cities, buildings have fewer floors,
  their cul-de-sacs are on a much smaller scale, and thus less pronounced.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Such areas represent terminal points. When these terminal developments are
  large in scale, they resemble a more specialized species. They are strongly
  environmentally dependent, with fewer opportunities for self-renewal. Such
  phenomena might not be immediately apparent, and the differences in urban
  developments often become distinguishable only after decades.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Comparing aerial photos of Yokohama from 1980 and 2010, we find that many old
  houses on traditional streets have undergone renovations and still stand,
  while a large number of public housing estates built in the 1970s have been
  demolished and replaced.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  <strong
    >Sixth, Chinese-style suburbs are more homogenous, more standardized, with
    many barracks-like residential areas.</strong
  >
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The prototype for Chinese suburbanization is Le Corbusier's "Towers in the
  Park" model, which inherently has a very uniform design. In China, this model
  has been implemented to an unprecedented scale in world history.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  This uniformity correlates with large-scale developments chasing efficiency.
  But it's not just that.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Chinese societal thinking is more polarized. Imagine a marketplace of ideas:
  usually, 80% of people believe in 20% of ideas as mainstream knowledge, with
  20% exploring the other 80%. In a more polarized idea market, 90% believe in
  just 10% of ideas, with the other 90% of ideas intriguing only 10% of the
  population.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Moreover, compared to other regions, Chinese real estate is less of a consumer
  good and more of an asset. I believe that Chinese residences have a strong
  monetary nature and serve as primary collateral for M2 (money supply). This
  means that both builders and buyers prioritize liquidity. Ideally, all houses
  should be similar, like banknotes, differing only in face value. This
  minimizes transaction costs. This trend is becoming increasingly evident.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  From aerial views, older projects appear more complex in design. The newer the
  project, the more uniform its design. You can discern that within a given
  area, there may be only two types of apartment blocks. It might even look like
  a table laid out with different denominations of banknotes.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Certainly, there's a wealth of detail I could delve into. However, for the
  sake of brevity and ensuring a digestible read, I've distilled my thoughts
  into the above six points.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Allow me to offer a brief commentary:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  When viewed through an evolutionary lens, the "Chinese-style suburbia" has
  undoubtedly matured into a significant ecological entity. It stands as a
  testament to the triumphs of China's economic reforms, showcasing immense
  financial and societal progress achieved through these transformative
  policies.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  However, I must emphasize that this Chinese suburban model has a pronounced
  consumption-driven nature. Its intensity might even be on par with the
  American suburbanization model. Reliant on the production capabilities
  unleashed by the economic reforms, this model may eventually become a
  bottleneck for further growth. Consequently, there are numerous facets of this
  model that warrant refinement or amendment. Perhaps we may even need to await
  technological advancements to alleviate the burdens it imposes.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Parallel Models</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Now, what parallel models exist in reality to this form of suburbanization?
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'd draw attention to the phenomenon of Dongguan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Initially, consider that Shenzhen is relatively compact. Dongguan and Shenzhen
  are essentially merging into a unified urban entity, sharing the economic
  infrastructure of a first-tier metropolis. One might even conceptualize
  Dongguan as an extended suburban area for Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Notably,
  Dongguan boasts a thriving manufacturing sector. However, its urban
  concentration isn't particularly dense, instead presenting a pattern of
  juxtaposed towns. Property prices there are considerably more affordable,
  approximately a quarter of those in Shenzhen. What does this signify?
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In Dongguan, a substantial proportion of urban development occurs on lands
  owned by residents. While most major cities witness a decline in such
  resident-owned land development, Dongguan maintains a more permissive stance
  toward spontaneous, grassroots developments.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  This kind of grassroots construction in urban villages significantly amplifies
  housing supply and productive spaces without necessitating much external
  input, resulting in minimal consumption.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Thus, Dongguan offers a relatively abundant housing supply for those employed
  in manufacturing and services. This ensures a robust economic vibrancy while
  maintaining a logical property price point. This model, with higher
  inclusivity and a nurturing environment, continuously evolves and upgrades as
  long as there's sufficient property rights protection.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Many may overlook the potential for such urban villages to autonomously
  upgrade. Yet, prime examples are evident in places like Nakano, Mitaka, and
  Kichijoji in Tokyo. Post-World War II, to address Tokyo's housing crunch, land
  near the Chūō Main Line's western suburbs was allocated and segmented into
  smaller residential plots. Initially, these areas catered to urban newcomers
  and migrant workers. Yet, over a span of 70 years, encompassing three
  generations, these locales have metamorphosed into renowned livable
  communities and hubs of cultural industries. This stands as a palpable
  alternative strategy.
</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这期谈中国式的郊区化，把它放在美国式郊区化的后面，是因为其中有相通之处，可以进行直接的对比。美国式的郊区化，从缺乏顶层设计的，理念层面是比较散漫的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  中国常见的郊区化，自上而下，它是受到官员和专家的行政控制的。专家是一个受到乌托邦现代主义建筑学影响很大的群体，按照处置国有资产的思路来处理城市土地的。他们是这个进程的头脑。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  中国郊区化的发展，自下而上，它的下半身是开发商，消费者，是市场化的、多元的、传统的、甚至观念古老的。受到本土民俗学、风水理论的一些影响。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这样的上身和下身，当然有所混溶，综合成一套独特的话语体系，遵循一套很特殊的逻辑。所以中国的郊区化呈现的结果独具一格，存在内在的不协调。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>能理解上下两头的立场和思想来源，有助于理解中国的城市发展的各种现象。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>中国的郊区化有鲜明的特点，我下面分析五个点：</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  第一，中国的郊区开发的本意是建设新的城市，但是在很多方面，采用了郊区的手法。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  比如，宽街道，超大街区，低密度路网，在道路两侧设置绿化带。这些都是典型的二战前的雅典宪章手法。实际上都是适用与郊区，而不利于城市经济的。把绿化带放在街道两边，起装饰左右，给人一种看上去很自然的印象。这符合朴素的，未经教育的城市形象观。我不做过多的展开。简单地说，对步行者不友好，街道活力被稀释。不利于商圈的整合和包容性的城市生态的孵化。导致中式的城市扩展具有郊区化的特征。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  第二，浦东新区，望京新城，浑南新城，等等等等，这类新区新城，是中国郊区化最突出的现象。不能说所有新城都很成功，但是有不少都相当成功。表现为，有些房价甚至超过老城，甚至出现了一些新城商业的繁荣。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  新区压过老区，这是一种后发优势的现象。全世界范围内，采用强计划手段，通过一张蓝图，整体规划而成功的新城，是非常罕见的，一般负面案例偏多。在中国，当然也有大量不成功的案例，但是却也有还差强人意的，这个词意思应该是褒义的。如我前面所说，有这样的好结果，必然是同时符合上下两个方面的立场的一种解决方案。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  从上面角度看，在中国，和做旧城改造相比，新城开发需要协调的关系比较简单，需要补偿的拆迁户也比较少。所以成本其实更低。而且形象和政绩更加显著。新城开发，是从抵抗力弱，效果明显的方向下手。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  从下面角度看，如同在美国的情况。新区一般是比较单纯的中产和小康的家庭，形成一个中产国中国，其实是符合消费者需求的。此外，新区一般停车位的供应比较充足，而传统市区停车位不足，也几乎没有增加车位的机会。所以，中产人口抛弃传统市区，向新区转移。传统市区的活力降低的现象。甚至新区商圈超过老商圈。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>重庆江北的发展分散了传统市区的热度，沈阳浑南新区也分散了市中心人口。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  当然，新区所谓的低成本是有条件的。也就是在缺乏高效的老区更新机制的情况下，新区开发的成本相对低。但是，新区的绝对成本是很高的。而且，一次性成本可能低。但是，长期成本是高的。涉及到：新的交通系统，新的商业服务业系统，新的医疗和学区系统——这些都需要重新组织，无法利用城市原有的系统。地方政府的负担变重，用户的实际使用费用也是偏高的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  只不过，中国在一个经济高速发展的时代，而且地方政府有出售土地的收入，这些负担也许、似乎还可以接受。但是，在经济相对平稳的发达国家，新城成功的机会小得多。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>第三，中国式郊区化的动力机制是汽车和公交的混合，提高了汽车依赖性。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在建设了城市间高速公路网之后，最近10年，很多二线城市发展了城市快速路系统。这极大的刺激了郊区化的发展。虽然，地铁、公交系统也发展了。但是小汽车的份额增加的快得多，使用者增加的多得多。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  中国小汽车保有量大概七八年翻一番，2021年，全国，包括农村人均小汽车的保有量大约0.2辆，大概日本的一半，美国的三分之一。如果考虑城市化水平，中国城市的小汽车保有量更接近日本，大概美国的一半。但是，要知道，每增加50%的小汽车，你会看到一个非常不同的城市生态。所以，你们正在经历城市环境的剧变，每三年一个台阶。我估计2013年到现在这个阶段，是汽车郊区发展速率的最大值。多数城市的交通阻塞情况明显加剧。传统市中心衰退的现象也在很多城市发生。如我之前讨论过的，汽车化这个倾向几乎是不可阻挡的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>第四，中国的郊区化主要是高密度的、密度比西方国家的汽车郊区高得多。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这主要是从下面看的，这是成本和市场导向的，因为中国的土地价格，从十年之前，就已经相对很贵。所以，高容积率摊低土地成本是非常重要的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>而从上面看，官方出于节约土地的理念，也出台了排斥1.0以下低密度开发的政策。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这样，中国郊区就划定了一条容积率底线。和我之前讨论过的美式的汽车郊区比，容积率要高若干倍。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这在任何一个规划专家看来都是优势。有利于商业服务业的孵化，有利于维持高效率的公交线路。也因此，对于不开车的人，这种高密度郊区体现了一些包容性。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  高密度，意味着局部城市快速路的压力更大。导致城市快速路迅速饱和。支线路网不得不一起发展。形成一种替代性道路更多的格局。由于高密度能容纳的人口更多，中式郊区摊大饼的范围要小于美式郊区。是相对节约资源的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  第五，中国式郊区，虽然是高层，但是和美国的低密度郊区拓扑关系上类似，尽端发达。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  什么叫尽端发达？就是有很多口袋装的空间、或者叫死胡同。每一个住宅区拓扑上就是一个口袋状死胡同，里面没有通过性的交通。此外，每一个塔楼拓扑上也是一个死胡同，所有人进去出来都是从一个楼门洞儿。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  您可能会说，这不是废话吗？难道还有什么房子不是这样吗？确实，除去商场之外，绝大多数的房子或者房间都是这种死胡同。但是，传统城市里的房子的层数少，尽端的规模小得多，所以程度也弱得多。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这些就是尽端。尽端发达，尽端规模大的区域，相当于一种更加特化的物种。它的环境依赖性强，自我更新的机会弱。你静态的对比看不出来，城市现象很多要经历几十年才能分辨出来。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  对比横滨1980年和2010年的航拍，发现传统街道上的老的小房子很多历经了更新还存在，但是更新1970年代的公营集合住宅大院反而大量被拆毁了，替换成了其他的类型。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>——————————————————————————</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>第六，中国式郊区的秩序更单一，更标准化，兵营状的住宅区比较多。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  中国式郊区的理念原型，柯布西耶式的“公园里的塔楼”Towers in the
  park这种模式的秩序本身就非常单一。在中国这种模式得到世界历史前所未有的最大限度的发挥。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>这和开发规模大，追求效率有关系。但是又不限于此。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  中国社会的认知更单极化。假设有一个思想市场，正常情况下，80%的人回去相信20%的东西作为主流知识，总有20%的人在探索其他80%的东西。而更单极化的思想市场，90%的人相信10%的东西，其他90%的思想只有10%的人感兴趣。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  此外，和其他地区相比，中国房地产消费品的属性更弱，资产属性更强。我有一个看法，中国住宅带有很强的货币性质，是M2的主要抵押物。也就是说，建造者和购买者都很注意它的流动性（Liquidity）。最好，每一个房子都差不多，和钞票一样。只有面值的差别，同一面值的钞票都一样。这样交易成本最低。而且，这种倾向越来越明显。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  你从航拍图上看，老的项目，秩序还复杂一点；越新的项目，它的秩序越单一。你都能看出来，在一块地里，只有两种板楼。甚至看上去就像在一张桌子上摆了几种面额的钞票。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  当然，能展开的事情还有很多。以上，是我归纳的五点。是为了控制在一个能吸收的篇幅。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>下面，做一个简单的评述，</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  从演化的角度，中式郊区，显然已经形成了一个不可忽视的生态群落。它就是改革开放成功的证明，表现出了改革开放创造出来的巨大的财务和社会进步。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  然而，我这里一直强调，这种模式，中式的郊区化，它的消耗性是很强的。甚至可能和美式的郊区化的消耗性有可比性。它肯定是依靠改革开放释放出来的生产力，搭改革开放的便车，有可能成为继续发展的拖累。所以，这里面有相当多的可以修补、需要修补的东西，也可能要等待新技术的出现来缓解它们造成的这种负担。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>——————————————</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>同时，说一下，现实中和这种郊区化相平行的模式是什么？</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>我认为应该观察：东莞的现象。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  我们首先看，深圳很小。东莞和深圳基本同城化，共享一个一线大都市圈得经济系统。你甚至可以把东莞理解成广州深圳的远郊城镇。东莞制造业非常发达。但是，市内中心化程度不高，呈现几个镇并列的局面。房价，相对便宜的。只相当于深圳的四分之一。这是一个什么现象？
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  我们看，东莞，在居民自有宅基地上进行的建设，占整个城市的比重很大。在主要大城市，村镇宅基地的发展被限制，份额逐渐减少的情况下。东莞对城中村的禁忌更少，对自发开发更宽容。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  城中村的自发建设，可以增加住房供应，增加生产性空间。但是不怎么需要外部输入。消耗性很小。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  所以，东莞针对制造业和服务员从业者的住房供应相对充足。保持着很强的经济活力和相对合理的房价。房价这就是一种包容度更高，孵化性更强的模式。而且这种城中村只要有足够的产权保障，它会不断的自我更新和自我升级。

  可能很多人没有把城中村自我升级的可能纳入视野当中。其实，案例就在那里摆着，东京中野、三鹰、吉祥寺地区的郊区化就是这种模式，战后，为了解决东京住房紧张的问题，在西郊中央本线铁路附近供应土地，切分为小块宅基地，最初是新城市人、或者说农民工建造小住宅的地方。但是，经过70年的演化，三代人的时间。这些地区已经成为著名的宜居社区和文化产业中心。这就是明摆在那里的替代性策略。
