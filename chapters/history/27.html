  Every individual starts from a single fertilized egg cell. This one cell
  divides into two, then four, and after countless divisions, by the time we
  mature, we consist of approximately 37.2 trillion (3.72 x 10¹³) cells. These
  cells form the four main types of tissues and 78 different organs within the
  human body. Each of these tissues and organs has a unique structure, and the
  cells vary among them:
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>Muscle tissue cells are fibrous.</li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>Neuronal cells from the nervous tissue extend long axons.</li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>Cells in bone tissue present a stellate pattern.</li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->

  <!-- wp:list-item -->
  <li>
    Lymphatic and blood cells float freely within their respective fluids.
  </li>
  <!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Organs each have their intricate designs. For instance, a tooth, which is an
  organ, has a mineral-rich hard outer shell, with dentin in the middle and a
  cavity containing nerves and blood vessels. The trachea, another organ, looks
  like the drain hose of a washing machine, with a series of cartilage rings. It
  divides into branches leading to the lungs. The appearance and destinies of
  cells are immensely varied. A neuronal cell can be over 1.5 meters long, while
  a red blood cell is just 5 micrometers in length—a 300,000-fold difference.
  Neurons can live for over a century, but the cells lining the stomach live
  only a few days—a difference in lifespan by ten thousand times.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Yet, it's essential to remember that all these cells originated from that
  initial fertilized egg, undergoing mitosis and self-replication, all carrying
  identical chromosomes and genetic information. How does this differentiation
  process occur?
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  After the initial cell divides several times, producing a cluster of cells,
  these cells recognize their position by chemical signals from their
  neighboring cells. If a cell is surrounded on all sides by other cells, it's
  in the center; if it has neighbors only on one side, it's on the outer
  surface. These positional stresses alter the transcription factors inside
  them, switching on different genes. This leads to differentiation into various
  embryonic layers.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  At this stage, the embryo is still amorphous, with no distinguishable head or
  tail. Any position could develop into the head or the buttocks of the
  individual. However, once it attaches to the uterine wall, signals from the
  uterus induce the embryo to differentiate its head and tail. The upper and
  lower halves activate different genetic switches, producing different proteins
  and releasing varied chemical signals. Influenced by these signals of varying
  intensities and characteristics, the cells divide and differentiate into arms,
  chest, heart, liver, and various other organs. Each cell autonomously
  differentiates to harmonize with its surrounding cells. If a cell from the
  upper body, for example, develops out of sync with its surroundings into a
  type suited for the lower body, abnormalities result.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  It's only through such intricate coordination that organs differentiate
  correctly. While a mature individual might seem ordinary, this "ordinary"
  development is, in fact, a genuine miracle.
</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Analogys to Morphogenesis</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Cities are often likened to living organisms, complete with analogous
  mechanisms at work.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  City walls function as the city's exoskeleton, with gates serving as its
  mouth; streets act as its circulatory system; markets are its lungs; barracks
  represent its fists; police and prisons function as its lymphatic system.
  Landmarks such as the Kremlin and the Tower of London stand as the city's
  skull, housing governing entities that act as its brain.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Cities around the world vary in appearance, yet on a macro level, they display
  striking similarities. Such shared characteristics arise from underlying human
  behaviors common across civilizations. Every building in a city, every
  drainage channel, stems from an individual decision-making process, mirroring
  the behavior of a dividing cell. But unlike cells, humans are swayed by a
  multitude of factors. Still, typically, every building's construction displays
  a heightened sensitivity to its environment.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Differentiation/Contextuality</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Houses near city gates or main streets? They often become shops, leading to
  the formation of commercial streets. Areas around wells or temples? They
  attract bustling crowds, making way for markets. Land situated far from main
  roads and gates, especially if low-lying, is less suitable for shops or
  residences, and more fitting for stables or vegetable gardens. Steep slopes?
  They're often transformed into terraced platforms for development, utilizing
  the natural topography to minimize the need for extensive land grading.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  If your neighbors' homes are built with stone and you're considering bricks,
  research might reveal that the local abundance of cheap stone makes
  brick-making unprofitable. Importing bricks from afar would be too costly.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Similarly, if neighboring buildings are five stories high and you're thinking
  of building only two, you might earn less. Erecting an eight-story building
  might be inconvenient for potential renters due to the climb, or might be met
  with resistance from neighbors due to its dominating presence. More often than
  not, your building will likely deviate only slightly in height from those
  surrounding it.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The architectural styles commonly adopted by your community often reflect
  accumulated experiences, cost-effective materials, local craftsmanship, and
  efficient design. Stubbornly choosing a non-standard design could lead to
  regrets.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Anyone who has studied a foreign language will be familiar with cloze tests,
  where words are omitted from a text and have to be filled in. The options to
  consider are usually limited. Similarly, in architecture, the feasible
  solutions offered by a given environment are finite.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Well-coordinated decisions respect various considerations and anticipate
  potential consequences. In urban studies, this concept is termed "contextual"
  or "contextuality"—meaning decisions that respect and consider surrounding
  environments.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Some translate it to "文脉" in Chinese, but this neologism can be hard to
  understand for some. At its core, it's a straightforward term meaning
  harmonious integration with the surroundings.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Traditional cities, as evolutionary victors, often feature buildings that,
  individually, might seem understated and blend into the background. Yet,
  collectively, they form vibrant, efficient landscapes.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  For instance, during the Qing Dynasty, there were no laws dictating that only
  courtyard houses (四合院) should be built in Beijing. Yet, over 90% of houses
  followed this design. Similarly, the ruins of ancient Pompeii in Italy reveal
  that about 90% were courtyard houses. Despite the 8,000 kilometers and over a
  millennium separating the two locations, both arrived at nearly identical
  architectural typology, suggesting the courtyard design was particularly
  viable in those contexts.

<p>
  Whales, descendants of a furry mammal resembling a weasel, after thousands of
  generations in the ocean, evolved to somewhat resemble sharks, distant
  relatives. Specific environments tend to steer evolution toward analogous
  outcomes.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  I mentioned the concept of "organicity" in the first installment of "The
  Cliché Pulverizer." Organicity doesn't simply pertain to winding, intricate
  appearances; such a facade might represent pseudo-organicity. True organicity
  implies comprehensive coordination.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The antithesis of coordination and contextuality in decision-making is
  "arbitrariness." Being arbitrary means making decisions with limited external
  considerations, insufficient information, and impulsive behavior. History is
  rife with examples of arbitrariness. Urban planning, in particular, has a
  history marked by numerous failures. There are many books discussing these
  failed instances. For example, Kenneth Kolson's "Big Plans: The Allure and
  Folly of Urban Design" delves into instances of arbitrariness in American
  urban planning history. In the midst of economic growth, an arbitrary urban
  plan might appear successful and functional on the surface. However, its
  essence is consumptive, merely hitching a ride on the era's coattails and
  draining the vitality of society. Yet, arbitrariness is straightforward, while
  true coordination requires knowledge, patience, and, most importantly,
  intricate organizational efforts.

  每个人都是从一个受精卵单个细胞开始，一个变两个，两个变四个，经过无数次分裂，到成熟的时候，有大概37.2万亿（3.72*10<sup>13</sup>）个细胞。这些细胞组成人体内的四大类组织，78种不同器官。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>这些组织、器官每个都有独特的结构，细胞也各不相同：</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  肌肉组织的细胞是纤维状的、神经组织的细胞是神经元拉着一条长长的线、骨组织的细胞呈现星云状、淋巴和血液的细胞是游离状的漂浮在液体里。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  器官们各自有复杂的结构，牙是一个器官，外面是矿物质硬壳，中间是牙本质，里面空腔里是神经和血管；气管也是一个器官，一节节的软骨环包着的一跟管子，模样像洗衣机排水管，下面有个三通的分叉，通向两边的肺。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  细胞的外观和命运非常不同——神经细胞能有1.5米多长，红血球细胞只有5个微米长，尺寸差30万倍。神经细胞能活超过100年，胃上皮细胞只能活几天，寿命差一万倍。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  但是，别忘了。它们都是最开始那一个受精卵，有丝分裂，自我繁殖形成的，它们都带着一模一样的染色体和遗传性息。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>这个分化过程是怎么发生的呢？</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  最初这个细胞分裂了几轮之后，产生了十几个细胞的时候，这些细胞通过周围兄弟细胞的化学信号，可以知道自己在中心还是外面。如果你四面八方都是兄弟，说明你在中心；如果只有一边有兄弟，说明你在外表面。应激性导致它们内部的转录因子会给基因打开不同的开关。里外会分化成不同的胚胎层。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  但是这时候胚胎还混沌一团，分不清头和尾。也就是说每个位置都可能成为人的脑袋，也可能成为臀部。但是，它接触到子宫壁之后，子宫壁会给它们一个诱导，让胚胎产生头和尾的分化。上半身和下半身会打开不同的基因开关，产生不同的蛋白质，各自释放不同的化学信号。然后受到左邻右舍不同强度和特征的化学信号，分裂成手臂和胸膛，心脏、肝脏，各种不同的器官。每个细胞，都自动分化成和周边细胞协调的类型。如果上半身的干细胞没有和周边协调，发育成为了下半身的干细胞。那就会产生畸形。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  只有非常精密的协调，最后，才会分化成一个个正常的器官，才能看起来是正常的，成为一个平淡无奇的人，其实这种平淡无奇的才是真正的奇迹。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>城市也经常被类比为一个有机体，里面有类似的机制。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  城墙是城市的外骨骼，城门是它的嘴巴；街道是它的循环系统；市场是它的肺；兵营是它的拳头；警察和监狱是它的淋巴；克里姆林宫和伦敦塔是城市的颅骨；里面居住着的统治机构是它的大脑。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  五湖四海的城市，形状各异，但是整体看很大程度上同构。这是其中蕴藏着的类似的人类行为使然。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  城市里每一栋房子，每一条排水沟。它们的建造，都是一套独立的决策过程，就像一个分裂中的细胞一样。只不过，人的想法比细胞要多得多。但是，即便如此，通常，每一个房子的建设，都是对环境高度敏感的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  城门口，主街边上的房子：会开商店；而且大家都会这样做，于是形成连续的商业街。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>水井口、神庙门口：人来人往，会出现集市。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>远离主路和城门的边角地、低洼地，不适合做商店、住宅，不如做马厩、菜园</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在陡坡上，会整理成梯田状的台地，在阶梯上开发；因山就势，可以节省土地平整的工程量。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  别人的房子都什么样，你最后做出的选择大概率也不会差太多。比如你隔壁的房子都是石板砌的，而你考虑用红砖；你调研之后很可能发现本地就是石头山，因为石材太便宜，所以没有人建砖窑。从外地运砖又会太贵。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  再比如，邻居都是五层的房子，你如果只建两层，你会比别人获利少；如果你要建八层，可能爬楼太累，租不出去；或者因为高度太压人遭到邻居的抵制。所以你大概率和邻居层差也就一两层以内。不是绝对的，但是是大概率如此。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  你左邻右舍通用的房子的类型，代表了长期积累的经验；便宜的材料、本地工匠擅长的建造技术，有效率的布局。如果，一意孤行选择了错误的类型，可能会吃亏的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  大家学外语应该都练过完形填空，在一段话里抠出来一个空白，让你填一个词进去，其实能考虑的选择并不是特别多。建筑也是一样，你置身于所处的环境中，真正合理的解决方案是有限的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  协调的决策，照顾很多方面的关系，瞻前顾后。城市学的术语称之为contextual，名词是contextuality。意思是：尊重上下文的，考虑周边环境的做事风格。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  有的人把它翻译成“文脉”。这样一个新词，反而难以理解了。它其实没有什么玄学，是一个很直接的单词，意思就是周边协调的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  传统城市都是演化史上的胜者，其实多数的房子都是很不突出的，融入背景的；但是它们构成的整体却是生动的、高效的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>大清朝并没有法律规定北京只能建四合院，但是最后，90%以上都是四合院。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  意大利的庞贝古迹也是90%的四合院。它和北京之间隔着8000公里，一千多年，两边也没有打过招呼，但是最终产生的结果和北京差不多，说明四合院是那个环境下有生存能力的类型。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  鲸鱼的祖先是一种长毛的、和黄鼠狼差不多的哺乳动物。但是它们进入大海几万代之后，变得和与他们亲缘关系比较远的鲨鱼有点像。特定环境下，演化趋向类似的结果。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  我在陈腐粉碎机的第一期里提到过的所谓的有机性。不是蜿蜒曲折的样子就一定是有机的，那可能是假有机。真正的有机的含义，就是广泛协调。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  和协调、和文脉相反的做事风格是“武断”，武断的意思就是考虑的外部条件少，掌握的信息不充分，由着性子。历史上武断的案例也是非常多的。城市规划的历史是一个充满失败的历史，讨论失败案例的书很多，比如Kenneth
  Kolson的《大规划——城市设计的诱惑和荒唐》，讲美国历史上的武断案例。在经济发展的红利里面，有时候，一个武断的规划，看起来好像还挺成功、还可以运转，但是它本质是消耗性的，是搭时代的便车、消耗社会的元气的。但是，武断是简单的，而协调需要知识，耐心，更需要复杂的组织工作。
