  In this chapter, we discuss the concept of "informal occupation". But what is
  informal occupation?

  Let's consider a real-life example. A couple moves into a new home, which has
  a large wardrobe. They each hang their clothes in the wardrobe: the husband on
  the left half, and the wife on the right. Initially, they seem to have an
  unspoken agreement to split the space evenly. However, as time passes, the
  wife's collection of clothes grows, filling her half and slowly encroaching on
  the husband's space. The husband doesn't mind, as he doesn't have as many
  clothes. Eventually, when he buys new winter clothes and runs out of space, he
  spots some room on top of the wardrobe. He neatly folds some of his clothes,
  places them in boxes, and stacks them up there. Initially, they had an
  unspoken rule: half the space for each. Yet, this boundary was silently
  breached. The wife crossed the middle line, and the husband claimed the top.
  All of this happened without any formal agreement. This is a perfect example
  of informal occupation.

  In the early days of human urbanization, there were no land certificates or
  clear boundaries of ownership. Land was abundant, and it was typically "first
  come, first served." Each household had just a small hut, and as long as they
  didn't block pathways or cause inconvenience, everything was fine. However, as
  population and wealth grew, households began to expand their possessions,
  building pens for sheep outside their homes or stacking grain and firewood.
  Those with a higher status in the community or those with more resources and
  larger families would have more say and would tend to occupy more land or
  better spots. All these occupations were informal. There were no set rules.
  But gradually, public spaces between huts began to feel the pressure, and
  ambiguous boundaries led to internal conflicts. At this point, establishing
  clear ownership became crucial.
</p>

<p>
  The ancient text "Lüshi Chunqiu" mentions, "In a forest, a rabbit runs, a
  hundred men chase it, because this rabbit has no owner. In a marketplace
  filled with rabbits, passersby won't even give them a second glance, not
  because they don't want rabbits, but because these rabbits already have
  owners." Ambiguous ownership leads to competition, and competition consumes
  vast resources. Thus, structures like fences and walls began to appear. They
  might not offer effective defense but served as markers of property claims. If
  these claims did not infringe on others' rights and went unchallenged, they
  eventually became more formalized. Informal occupation can thus be seen as the
  precursor to property rights, emerging from the interactions and contests of
  this phase.
</p>

<p>
  Even the streets of traditional cities are a result of informal occupation.
  People would claim land alongside roads, building as close to the streets as
  possible to assert their boundaries. Yet, there's a limit – they couldn't
  obstruct traffic. Everyone tends to push this boundary as much as possible
  without infringing on the broader public interest. As a result, you get
  orderly, continuous rows of buildings right up against their plot boundaries,
  hugging the streets. Traditional cities didn't have gardens opening onto
  streets since it wasn't conducive for stable occupation.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  While streets were left unoccupied to avoid public outrage, airspace above
  them was often fair game. Overhangs from second floors jutted out further than
  those on the first, creating additional space. This behavior was tolerated in
  many cities and is especially common in early commercial settlements like in
  Italy and the Netherlands.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In the rainy cities of Southeast Asia, these overhangs, which offer shelter
  from rain, are very beneficial for commercial streets. Some overhang so much
  that they require columns on the streets, becoming colonades. originating in
  India and Singapore. They're popular architectural features in cities like
  Guangzhou and Xiamen.
</p>

  In terms of informal occupation, the game rules still apply. Whoever creates
  more value has a better chance to dominate. If the husband leaves his space in
  the wardrobe unused, not creating any value, the wife might stuff her clothes
  into it, putting the space to good use. By the time she occupies the wardrobe,
  she has established a status quo. If the husband protests, he would infringe
  on the wife's interests, resulting in her resistance. Regaining his original
  equal space in the wardrobe becomes a challenge. Therefore, changing an
  established fact often comes at a cost, sometimes quite high. A more
  cost-effective alternative might be to just occupy the top part of the
  wardrobe and make concessions.

  In Nepal, there are instances where residents without homes occupy public
  green spaces, setting up prefabricated houses. In Beijing, "Da Zayuan" (*<em>
    is a type of residential environment in Beijing, a representation of how
    historical urban areas adapted to accommodate increasing populations and
    changing social structures.)</em
  >
  represents residents who informally occupy public courtyards to build private
  homes. These are cases of informal occupation. In such scenarios, the
  authorities have the right to dismantle these structures to restore the public
  land. However, evicting these residents might render them homeless. Should the
  authorities then provide temporary housing? If the husband evicts his wife's
  clothes from the wardrobe, doesn't he still need to buy a new one? Doesn't
  that come with its own costs?
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  If the authorities lack the resources to intervene, they might tolerate this
  informal occupation. The longer the wife occupies the wardrobe, the more
  justified it seems. Later, when their child grows up, having always seen the
  wardrobe predominantly filled with the mother's clothes, the child will
  naturally assume it's the mother's. If earlier generations don't challenge
  these occupations, the chance for subsequent generations to challenge
  diminishes. Informal occupation, when passed down generations, is more likely
  to become semi-formal, perhaps even officially recognized. From an economic
  standpoint, if such occupation doesn't infringe on (or seriously harm) others'
  rights and creates well-being for the occupier, isn't it a kind of Pareto
  improvement?

  During the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, a population decline resulted in a
  large amount of unused land. Essentially, whoever cultivated it, owned it. As
  for the Roman Empire in its later stages, amidst upheaval, many properties and
  streets were abandoned. Roads that were once meticulously planned and broad
  became redundant. Residents expanded their homes onto these streets, leaving
  just enough width for passage. As a result, roads became winding and twisted.
  Some properties remained unclaimed, and buildings collapsed, allowing new
  paths to be formed across vacant plots. Streets unused by anyone could be
  completely occupied, or even merged with properties across the road. Public
  buildings managed by the government, such as the Baths of Nero, became
  dilapidated as their materials were stolen to construct private homes, leading
  to their gradual disappearance. Theaters and arenas with sturdy structures
  often saw their underground spaces divided and occupied by homeless families.
  Squatter houses began to appear in squares. After the fall of the Empire, with
  the collapse of administrative systems and authority, a state of anarchy
  prevailed, and informal occupation became rampant.

  To formalize these occupations isn't a challenge. Cities and feudal lords need
  to collect taxes, and before doing so, they would organize property
  registration. As long as no disputes arise during this process, these informal
  occupations can easily become official, much like children born out of the
  official population policy getting registered during a census. Once you have
  the deed, you can treat the property as inherited and develop it further. Over
  a prolonged period, a new order emerges from the chaos of the old empire.
  Nomads form guilds and free city-states, and descendants of refugees become
  bourgeoisie. Haphazardly built structures evolve into works of art over
  centuries. For example, theaters by the Tiber River in Rome, once divided
  among many families, now comprise luxurious residences, retaining their
  circular facade. Though, like the Ship of Theseus, most bricks aren't original
  anymore. These residences now even feature elevators. Observing this
  miraculous rebirth always leaves me profoundly moved. Informal occupation
  plays a significant role in human settlements, occasionally acting as a
  pivotal element. While informal occupations come with controversies and
  disputes, they aren't as dreadful as imagined. They are generally based on
  mutual respect and the broader public interest, ensuring the game isn't pushed
  too far.

  The most intense and unequal occupations are conducted through force and
  authority – these are conquests. Both formal and informal occupations are
  highly vulnerable in the face of conquerors.

  这期讨论，非正式的占据，这个概念，英文叫informal
  occupation。它是城市研究方面特别重要，也是特别有意思的一个概念。什么是非正式占据呢？
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  举一个生活中的例子。一男一女两口子搬到新家，新家有个新的大衣柜。夫妻各自把自己的衣服挂进去。男的挂在左边一半，女的挂右边一半。形成默契，分的挺好的。不过，很快，太太的衣服越来越多，把右边一半挂满了，就开始往左边挂，挤进先生挂衣服的空间里。先生也没意见，因为他本来衣服就少。但是，不久，先生买了新的冬装。没地方放了。他一看，柜子顶板的上面还有一些空间。他就把自己一些衣服叠起来，装进盒子，放在柜子顶上，把上面占满了。最开始，它们有过一个默认的规矩，就是一人一半。然后，它们默默地突破了这个规矩。女的越过了中线，男的占据了顶上。这都是之前没有约定好的。这就是非正式的占据。
</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在人类的城市起源的时候，那时候没有土地证，没有明确的所有权界限，而且地方有的是，先到先得。而且，每家就一个茅屋，只要别挡大家的路，不怎么碍事就没有问题。但是，渐渐的，人口和财富增加了，每家都会增加新的东西。比如在屋外面围一个羊圈。堆一些谷仓和木柴。谁家的家长地位高，谁家东西多，儿子多，不好惹，大家就会让着他们一些。他们就又能力多占些地方，占好一点的地方。这些占据都是非正式的。没有什么确定的规矩。但是，渐渐的，茅屋之间的公共区域就会变得紧张。这时候，模糊的边界，就会引发内部矛盾。这时候明确所有权，是非常必要的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  吕氏春秋说的：一只兔子跑，一百个人追。因为这只兔子没有所有者。市场上堆满了兔子，路过的人看都不看一眼，不是他们不想要兔子，是因为这些兔子是有所有者的。模糊的所有权导致争夺，争夺会消耗大量资源。于是，就出现栏杆、围墙这类构筑物，不见得能有效防卫，但是可以用来主张产权。如果，这些占据没有侵害别人的利益，没有人出来挑战。他就形成比较正式的权利了。所以，非正式占据，是产权形成的前奏。产权是占据阶段博弈的结果。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  甚至，传统市区的街道，就是非正式占据的结果。人们沿着道路占据土地，它们要尽量贴着街道，修建建筑或者围墙，这样才能主张明确的边界，然而，它们有一个底线是，不能太靠前，不能妨碍交通。交通，涉及到广泛的公共利益。所以，大家总是倾向于，在不突破公共利益底线的前提下，尽量向前。最后，形成整齐的，连续的街墙，每一栋房子，都顶着自己地块的边界，贴着街道。这是公私利益博弈的平衡状态。传统城市里，没有菜园对着街道，因为那样不利于占据，不能形成稳定态。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  人们会在地面上保留街道，避免占据街道引发公愤。但是，在街道的上空，占据经常还可以继续。二层悬挑出来比一层更突出街道，这样就可以产生更大的面积。这种行为在很多城市也得到了容忍。在意大利和荷兰都比较常见。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在多雨的东南亚城市，这种悬挑因为可以给路人挡雨，对商业街非常有利。有的挑出的特别多，以至于必须有一排柱子落在街道上。这就是骑楼。起源于印度和新加坡。在广州、厦门非常流行，成为一个建筑现象。
</p>

<p>非正式博弈还遵循什么规律呢？</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  谁创造的价值大，谁就有更大得机会占据。老公把大衣柜里的空间空着，不创造价值；太太就会把自己衣服塞进去，让这个空间创造价值。太太占据老公的大衣柜，制造了既成事实；这时候，老公如果抗议，他就会破坏太太的利益，受到太太的抵制。他要恢复他原来平分大衣柜的权利，会很费劲。所以，你要改变既成事实，是需要花费成本的；有时候这个成本特别高；而你有成本更低的解决方案，就是占据大衣柜顶部。这时候，你就会让步。
</p>

<p>
  在尼泊尔存在没有房子的居民占据公共绿地搭建彩钢房的行为。北京的大杂院，其实也是居民占据公共的宅院，私自建房的情况。这就是一种非正式占据。这种情况下，管理者有权强拆这些占据，恢复公共土地原状。但是，你要赶走这个居民，会导致他无家可归。你是不是还得帮他解决临时住房呢？先生把太太的衣服赶出自己的衣柜，那他是不是还得买新衣柜呢？那不是一样需要成本吗。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  如果管理者手里没有这个资源，那可能你就会纵容这种非正式占据。太太占据衣柜的时间越久，就显得越理所当然。以后，他们的孩子长大了。孩子从小就看到这个衣柜有一大半是妈妈的。他就会理所当然的认为，这本来就是妈妈的衣柜。如果人们的长辈都没能挑战这些占据，他们后辈挑战的机会就更小了。非正式的占据，一旦跨代了。就会大概率变成半正式的。甚至可以得到上户口的机会。从经济学角度，如果这种占据，没有破坏（或者没有严重破坏）别人的权利，有给自己创造了福利。那么这岂不就是一种帕累托优化。

  在东汉末年，人口损失、流散的时候，出现了大量的荒田。这时候，基本上，谁开垦，这个地就是谁的。到这里，可能，我们感觉非正式占据，都是些小打小闹。不过这些小动作，经过时间的积累，可以改变道路网格和城市格局。在罗马帝国晚期的动荡之中，居民死走逃亡，十室九空。出现了大量的无主地产和无人街道。原来规划整齐，方方正正的路网，十几米宽的街道，在这时候显得多余。居民即使向街道扩建房屋，只留下五六米的通行宽度，也足够通行。不会妨碍任何人。而居民占据街道的时候，不会保持整齐。有的在左侧，有的在右侧。道路于是变得弯弯曲曲。有些地产空置无主，房屋倒塌，于是，人们可以走捷径，斜穿这些空地。在原来的方格之间，形成斜向的新路。无人经过的街道，甚至可以完全占据，乃至于可以并吞街道对面的无主地产，连城一片。于是又有很多街道消失。过去由政府管理的公共建筑，比如尼禄大浴场，现在无人维护。建筑材料被居民偷走建造自己家的房屋，以至于这些堂皇的巨大建筑逐渐消失。剧场、竞技场，结构非常坚固。它们的看台下面的空间，经常被无房的家庭占据，砌墙切分，变成若干户住宅。广场上也出现零七八碎的房子。帝国灭亡后的城市，行政管理机构瓦解，威权粉碎。呈现肌体死亡后降解、溃败的场面。非正式的占据大行其道。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  非正式的占据，要正式化并不困难。城市、诸侯都需要收税；收税之前他们会组织产权登记，这个时候，只要没有人重复登记，没有引发争议。非正式的占据就很容易借这机会上户口，你就可以拿出产权证了。就好像超生黑户的小孩借着人口普查上户口一样。拿了产权证，就可以当成自己家的祖传财产，好好建设了。然后，经历了一个漫长的过程，新的秩序又会从帝国的残躯上产生。流民组合成行会和自由城邦，难民的后代成为布尔乔亚。当年胡乱拼凑的房屋，经过几百年，多次的翻建，变成了精致的艺术。罗马台伯河边的剧院，被几十个家庭瓜分，成为几十栋高级住宅。它们整体组成的轮廓还是原来那个圆圆的形状。但是，好像忒修斯之船，除了地基，多数砖都不是原来的。这些住宅现在甚至装上了电梯。目睹这样惊心动魄的重生，总让我感到深深的震撼。非正式占据，在人类聚落的历史上，相当重要；甚至在有些场合充当了关键角色。非正式占据，是充满矛盾的争议的，但是没有大家想象的那么恐怖。它们还是以对等，尊重他人利益和公共利益为基础的；进行的是一种比较柔和的博弈，不可能搞得特别过分。
</p>

  最激烈、最不平等的占据，是通过强权、暴力进行的，这就征服；征服者可以随意改变土地所有权和土地附着的财税义务。不管正式的还是非正式的占据，在征服者的面前都是非常脆弱的。
