<p>
  In this installment, I'd like to clarify a core concept that runs through my
  series: cities are the hardware of three types of human societal organization.
  Modern humans differ little from their counterparts tens of thousands of years
  ago in terms of individual innate attributes. However, today's collective
  human abilities are far more powerful. This discrepancy arises from the
  intricate organizational systems we possess. At their core and most profound
  level, cities serve as the hardware for organizing people. The form of a city
  also embodies organizational strength, which can be categorized into three
  main types:
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  <strong>Firstly, economic organization</strong>. This facilitates more
  efficient solutions to basic human needs, such as food and warmth, while
  generating wealth. Surplus wealth provides the cushion needed to spur varied
  advancements and innovations. More intricate organizations foster broader,
  large-scale trade and collaborative work. Those in charge of economic matters
  are often known as guild masters, bosses, or managers. In the physical realm
  of cities, this is manifested in factories, workshops, roads, warehouses, and
  trading venues.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  <strong>Secondly, defense organization</strong>. This ensures the safety of
  individuals, families, and larger groups in terms of both physical safety and
  property protection. The liberty that stems from such security is crucial for
  nurturing order. More often than not, security is not achieved individually
  but collectively. Historically, those in charge of security have typically
  been kings, nobles, or warriors. In terms of urban infrastructure, this is
  represented by walls, moats, gates, barracks, and towers. These structures
  elevate the costs for potential invaders, deterring aggression and fostering
  periods of peaceful development.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  <strong>Thirdly, ideological organization</strong>. Using tools such as faith,
  worship, and identity, it is possible to establish a virtual community. This
  not only facilitates alliances both internally and externally, reducing the
  intensity of potential conflicts and destructions but also builds trust,
  lowering the transaction costs in economic organizations. Those at the helm of
  such organizations are often referred to as priests, shamans, historians,
  scholars, pastors, teachers, or political workers. The importance of
  ideological organization is a hallmark of advanced civilizations. Within the
  urban context, this is reflected in monuments, public buildings, and various
  culturally and ceremonially significant constructions and spaces.

<p>
  These three organizational powers are embodied in various artifacts in
  civilized societies. To illustrate, consider two cartoons. First, imagine a
  silhouette of an average person. We make three copies. To the first, we add a
  defensive weapon, a sword. He then appears somewhat aggressive, reminiscent of
  a bandit. To the second, we dress him in a suit and grant him a ceremonial top
  hat. Now, he seems to exude authority, much like an Orient Express conductor.
  To the final one, we give a full ensemble—a suit, a top hat, and a sword.
  Suddenly, he takes on the air of nobility, even resembling Emperor Franz
  Joseph of Austria.
</p>

<p>
  For the next cartoon, envision a simple one-story house. Again, we produce
  three replicas. The first one is elevated to a three-story building. Although
  still plain, it suggests a prime location, much like an inn from the Chinese
  series "My Own Swordsman." To the second, we add ceremonial decorations, like
  ornate ridges on its roof, transforming it into something resembling a small
  temple, where one might expect devotees to visit. Lastly, upon the three-story
  building, we place the decorations, set it on a grand stone base, and it
  evolves into a majestic castle, reminiscent of the stronghold from where Oda
  Nobunaga once ruled.

  Cities and architecture establish organizational strength and order through
  their various components. I've previously discussed the mechanisms of defense
  systems in my 99th issue, so I won't delve into it again. Let me expand a bit
  on the tangible representations of ideational organization:
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  A piece of clothing serves not only to maintain warmth and protect the body
  but can also signify one's social status or even political leanings. Whether
  Zuckerberg wears a hoodie or a suit and tie, both choices are laden with class
  distinctions and representational meanings. Furniture, ranging from the
  simplest to the ornately decorated or the sleekly modern, has consistent
  functional purposes. However, it reflects the owner's cultural preferences and
  affiliations. A simplistic entrance to a residential community might
  disappoint potential buyers. There was a news story this year about a
  homebuyer who loudly protested in front of a developer's office, claiming that
  the main gate was an embarrassment and he sought to restore dignity for the
  residents. His point was valid. A gate is not just a physical security measure
  but also carries symbolic value. The doors of the courtyard homes during the
  Ming and Qing dynasties in Beijing strictly corresponded to the homeowner's
  status. Wealthy merchants, while commoners, differentiated themselves with
  lavish decorations. In the ancient city of Pompeii in Italy, the colorful
  mosaics in front of the houses showcased the owner's wealth and artistic
  taste. Reputation and face are crucial, influencing one's personal influence,
  the cost of transactions, and even mate selection. In other words, uniting
  people through shared concepts to transact or act collectively is significant.
  Investment in preserving and showcasing face, through commemorative or
  political constructions, is prioritized by everyone from emperors and nobles
  to merchants and commoners. Those with abundant resources invest more in
  maintaining face. The grandest buildings in cities are often banks and
  insurance companies, their solid granite façades symbolizing centuries of
  endurance. Urban roads are not merely transport infrastructures; magnificent
  boulevards are monuments themselves, representing the political prowess of
  rulers. All entities, throughout ages and classes, optimize their position in
  these organizational realms based on their circumstances and stances.
</p>

<p>
  From prehistoric times, people adorned and carved their primitive huts to
  display wealth and status. The higher the status, the larger and more refined
  the carvings. These structures served as tools to imprint class order onto
  people's hearts. Even in egalitarian eras, some architects, driven by
  idealism, deliberately built undecorated, austere, and standardized houses to
  express an egalitarian ideology. Without a doubt, they were creating
  distinctions from the old order, with an equally strong intent of establishing
  a new order. However, such constructions by these 'progressive' architects
  didn't resonate with the masses; instead, they evoked admiration from a
  distance. Their detachment from the public and their impulse to erect
  monuments for themselves were no less than that of ancient monarchs.
</p>

<p><strong>the Overstated Security and Monumental Elements</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The perspectives of rulers and the ruled both align and conflict. The
  difference is that when conflicts arise, the ruled usually lack the means to
  inflict significant harm on rulers. Rulers, with their power, have more
  chances to implement their intentions, and when they cause harm, it's more
  conspicuous. The Han and Tang dynasties' capital, Chang'an, implemented
  curfews in every district, with residents effectively living in 'soft
  prisons', restricted from venturing out at night. This infringed on their
  freedoms and economic interests but efficiently curtailed possible revolts and
  reduced security costs. In Bucharest, Romania, during Ceaușescu's reign, vast
  areas of the historic city center were demolished to make way for grand
  avenues and monumental government buildings, like the Palace of the
  Parliament. The demolition's extent was likened to the destruction caused by
  the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. Locals coined the term "Ceaushima" – a fusion of
  "Ceaușescu" and "Hiroshima" – to refer to the devastated area.
</p>

<p>
  While appropriate monument construction can foster organizational cohesion,
  overzealous monument building can be a risky gamble, sometimes backfiring on
  its creator.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  <strong>The pattern of a city reflects its social structure</strong> and the
  balance of power among the various classes.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In Tokyo, the design of many areas is intricate and irregular, characterized
  by urban village bases, small-scale industries, and a maze of tiny streets and
  alleys. Main roads primarily serve as transportation routes, lacking
  monumental significance. However, individual buildings are generally clean and
  respectable; traffic congestion is not severe. Large real estates and capital
  are primarily evident in areas with special historical backgrounds and
  especially central commercial districts. This design mirrors a society
  primarily composed of commoners and a government that serves its citizens.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  London's streets are winding and complex. The city has a significant
  proportion of medium-scale industries and old buildings, all of high
  architectural quality from various eras. There are no monumental avenues. The
  city's layout reveals a society that has remained stable for centuries and the
  accumulation of diverse traditional powers.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Paris, before the mid-19th century, had a layout similar to London's—filled
  with small streets and alleys. Under the reign of Napoleon III, Baron
  Haussmann supervised the construction of a radiating network of roads,
  amplifying the city's monumental aspect. This project gave Paris a distinct
  character, but it was also a source of significant controversy. Additionally,
  the Haussmann renovations seem to mark a watershed moment in French history.
  Paris, with its narrow lanes from the Valois dynasty to Napoleon I, did not
  hinder the French military from dominating Europe. Yet, by 1870, with its
  newly designed grand boulevards, France quickly lost the Franco-Prussian War
  and thereafter relied repeatedly on allies to defend itself.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Of course, it wasn't Paris's urban renovation that led to France's martial
  decline. Such a project doesn't have that much influence. Instead, this
  project reflected the decay of French grassroots society and the zenith of its
  bureaucratic system. As the saying goes, "From a single twig, one can predict
  the coming of autumn." The character of a city often accurately mirrors the
  power structure of the society in which it exists.

  Economics, defense, and ideas—the discussion about these three organizational
  forces will continue throughout my series.

  这期，我对贯穿我这个系列的一个核心概念进行一下说明。那就是，城市是人类社会三种组织力的硬件。现代人类与几万年前的人类在个体先天条件上差异不大,但是现代人作为群体的能力强大得多。这种差异的根源是现代人具有更复杂的组织体系。城市，从最基础、最深刻的层面，就是用于组织人群的硬件。城市的形式也是组织力的表达。组织力可以归纳为三大类：
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  其一，经济组织。帮助人群更有效率的解决温饱问题，并且创造财富；剩余财富的作用是给更多样的秩序的产生提供资源余量，也就是说，创新需要有资源剩余来支持；更复杂的组织促进更广泛、更大规模的贸易和分工合作。经济事务的组织者被称为行会会长、老板或者经理。在城市硬件上体现为工场、作坊、道路、仓库、交易场所。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  其二，防御组织。保护个人、家庭和团体的人身安全、财产安全；基于安全的自由是秩序生长的重要因素。安全一般不是通过个人，而是通过组织实现的。安全事务的组织者，历史上一般以国王、贵族、武士的身份出现。在城市硬件中体现为围墙、壕沟、门禁、兵营和塔楼等。它们提高侵略者的成本，来遏制侵略事件，提供阶段性和平发展的可能性。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  其三，观念组织。通过信仰、崇拜、认同这些观念工具，可以构建虚拟共同体；可以帮助实现内部和外部的统战，降低内外之间斗争和破坏的烈度，从而降低实现安全的成本；也可以构建信用，降低经济组织的交易成本；观念的组织者，被称为祭司、巫、史、儒生、牧师、教师、政工干部。观念组织是高级文明的重要特征。在城市硬件中体现为纪念碑、公共建筑和其他有仪式感的、有文化意味的建筑和空间的各个局部。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  上述这三种组织力，反射在文明社会各种的器物当中，我通过画两幅漫画来说明，秩序的产生。我们画一个站立的人的剪影。就是一个普通人，没有什么特点。我们复制三个。第一个，给他加上军事防卫的工具，一把佩刀。这时候，他看起来有一点攻击性，好像一个匪徒。第二个，穿上西装，再给他一个仪式感的工具，一顶高帽子。这时候，他看起来好像有一点权威感，好像东方列车的列车长。最后一个，给他全套的东西，一身西装，一顶高帽子和一把佩刀。这时候他看起来就是一个贵族了，甚至你可以说他是奥皇弗朗兹约瑟夫。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  另外一个漫画。我们画一个最普通不过的小平房。也是复制三个。第一个，我们把这个房子拔高，变成三层的。这时候，虽然它看起来仍然简简单单，但是它好像是一个很好的区位才会盖的房子，很像武林外传里的酒家客栈。第二个，我们在原来的小平房上面加上一些有仪式感的装饰，比如屋檐上加上鸱吻嘲风，同样一个房子，看起来就有点像个小庙，感觉有可能会有香客跑进来。最后，我们把在那个酒家一样三层的房子上，加上装饰，鸱尾嘲风，再把他放在高高的石头基座上，这时候，它就是一个天守阁，织田信长统治天下的地方。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  城市和建筑，就是通过这些元素的堆砌，来形成组织力，构建秩序的。我在之前，第99期，讨论过防御系统的机制。这次就不再重复。下面我对观念层面的组织力的硬件，稍微展开：
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  一件衣服，不仅能够保持体温，保护身体，一般也能体现社会身份，甚至体现政治偏好。扎克伯格穿帽衫还是穿西装领带，都带有强烈的阶级性和观念性。一件家具，从最简单的，到装饰华丽的，再到现代而简洁的。它的使用功能一样的，但是反应主人的文化站队。一个小区的大门比较简朴，可能会引起客户的不满。今年社会新闻中，有一位购房者在开发商门前怒吼，说这个大门让大家丢了面子，他要为大家要回面子。他说的很有道理。大门不止是一个门禁安保的硬件，也是一个观念性的硬件。明清北京的四合院的门，严格的对应主人的身份，富商，虽然也只能用平民的格式，但是可以进行华丽的装饰，体现和普通平民的区别。意大利庞贝古城的四合院，门前五光十色的马赛克铺地，反应主人的财富和艺术修养。面子是非常重要的，对一个人的影响力，他和别人达成交易的成本，甚至择偶，都会产生影响。换句话说，通过观念来团结人，来达成交易，来一致行动，意义重大。在面子上投资，进行纪念性、政治性的建设，从帝王、贵族到商人、平民都是看重的。资源越充足的人，在面子上投入越大。一个城市里最体面的建筑一般都是银行和保险公司，坚实的花岗岩外墙，要表达一种屹立千年的印象。城市中道路不仅仅是交通设施，美丽的或者体面的大道就是纪念碑本身。是统治者政治能力的表达。所有时代，所有阶级，各种层次的行为主体，都根据它们自身的条件和立场，去优化它们在这三种组织力场中的位置。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  从史前时代起，人们在原始茅屋上，进行装饰、雕刻，用来体现屋主人的财富和地位。地位越高的人，鸱尾的尺寸越大，雕刻越精美。它们，是把阶级秩序映射入人心的工具。即便在平等主义的时代，知识分子建筑师会故意建造一些去除一切装饰，朴素，无差别的标准化房屋，来表达其平等主义意识形态。但是，毫无疑问，它们其实也是在制造和旧秩序的差别，其建立新秩序的意味同样强烈。而且，白左建筑师制造的这些东西，并没让群众理解，只是让他们不明觉厉。他们脱离群众的程度，为自己制造纪念碑的冲动，不亚于旧时代的君王。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  统治者的立场和被统治者的立场，既有一致，也有冲突。区别是，在有冲突时，被统治者没有条件给统治者造成特别大的伤害；而统治者更具有实施其意图的机会，所以当它造成伤害的时候，更加的显性。汉唐长安，对各个里坊，实现封闭和宵禁。居民生活在夜间禁止外出的软性监狱里。这当然不符合居民的行动自由和经济利益，但是可以有效的防控暴动，降低治安防范成本。罗马尼亚的布加勒斯特，在齐奥塞斯库执政期间，为了建设了宏伟的轴线和巨大的纪念性政府建筑——共和国宫。不惜整体拆除了这座历史文化名城核心的三个平方公里的区域。相当于广岛核弹的破坏范围。市民把齐奥塞斯库的名字和广岛Hiroshima拼贴到一起，组合成一个新词“齐奥岛”Ceaushima，用来称呼他拆迁的这个区域。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  合理的纪念物建设，有利于促进组织的形成。夸张的纪念物建设，则是一场豪赌，有时候损害建设者本人。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>一个城市的格局，体现其社会结构，各阶级之间的力量对比。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  东京的大部分地区建筑图案非常细碎，不整齐，具有城中村宅基地小产业和小街小巷的格局。主路一般只具有交通功能而缺乏纪念性。然而一个个小建筑一般是干净、体面的；交通堵塞也不严重。大地产、大资本只体现在个别有特殊历史背景的地区，和特别核心的商业地区。这体现的是平民为主体社会结构和服务性的政府经营理念。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  伦敦，街道极其蜿蜒复杂，中型产业占比较大，老建筑占比高，各年代建筑品质都很高；没有纪念性的大道。这体现了一个持续几百年的稳定社会，和多元化传统势力的积淀。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  巴黎，在19世纪中叶之前，是和伦敦非常相似的小街小巷的城市。拿破仑三世时代奥斯曼男爵主持修建的放射状路网系统，使得巴黎的纪念性非常发达。成为了一个特色鲜明的城市，然而这个工程也具有很强的争议。而且，奥斯曼工程几乎是法国历史的分水岭。从瓦鲁瓦王朝到拿破仑一世之间几百年小街小巷小巷的巴黎，没有影响法国军队横扫欧洲，而拥有了时髦巴黎的1870年法国，却立刻输掉了普法战争，并且在未来失去了独立生存的能力，屡屡依赖英美的救助来赢得战争。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  当然，并不是巴黎的工程毁掉了法国，一个工程没有整么大影响力。而是，这个工程反应了法国基层社会的退化和官僚制度的鼎盛。一叶落而知天下秋。城市的性格，经常非常精确地反应它所处的社会的权力构造。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>经济、防御和观念，关于这三种组织力的讨论，还会继续贯穿我的这个系列。</p>
