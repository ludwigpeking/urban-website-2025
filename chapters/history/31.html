<p>
  In this installment, I'll introduce a method of analysis, which serves as a
  supplement to the previous discussions on the dynamics of urban evolution.
  Let's briefly review what was discussed before. In the 13th lecture of this
  series, I compared the flow of resources and technology to electrical
  potential differences and transportation factors to conductors. Potential
  difference arises when one region possesses resources and technology while
  another lacks them, leading to a need for exchange. Realizing this exchange
  creates value. It's important to note that this potential difference is not
  due to distance but rather heterogeneity. For instance, Papua New Guinea and
  Congo are 13,000 kilometers apart with little need for exchange, while
  Tsinghua University and Wudaokou, only a few hundred meters apart, have
  intense exchange needs.
</p>

<p>
  Within human populations, there is inherent division of labor, leading to
  heterogeneity. Resources and technology are, to a significant extent, people
  themselves. Cities can generate substantial potential differences simply
  through the internal division of labor among its residents. In large cities,
  people frequently change where they dine—Italian today, Thai tomorrow. In
  villages, however, most meals are home-cooked. In the city, a person might
  ride in a car driven by a stranger, send dozens of emails, collaborate with
  hundreds, and patronize various venues for shopping and entertainment. In a
  village, daily entertainment might consistently be a game of mahjong with the
  same group of people. Human settlements adhere to the network effect: the more
  users, the greater the value. The potential difference created within a large
  city far surpasses that in a village. Greater potential difference and lower
  resistance mean a stronger flow of resources and technology, leading to
  greater wealth and complexity.
</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  More complex orders lead to finer divisions of labor and greater potential
  differences. To establish a particular division of labor, a certain scale is
  required. Only at this scale can enough momentum be generated for the
  emergence of specific industries and order. This principle is similar to the
  critical mass needed for a nuclear explosion. Every American city has
  hairdressers, but not necessarily Japanese cuisine. Both are relatively
  general industries.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Certain specialized industries require accumulation at specific levels, and
  it's not just about comparing populations. Frankfurt is much smaller than New
  Delhi, but its financial sector is much more robust. Hengdian is tinier than
  Lagos, but its film and television industry is much stronger. Princeton is
  much smaller than Buenos Aires, but its scientific output is significantly
  greater. Such flows within cities are short-ranged and multi-leveled.
</p>

<p>
  In this lecture, I'll introduce another analogy used in urban research: the
  "thermal map." If you were to view someone with an infrared thermal imager,
  warmer areas would appear redder, while cooler areas would be greener. This is
  a thermal map. Urban researchers use similar tools, often mapping populations
  or specific geographic information. Red or certain markers indicate the "heat"
  or activity in urban areas. It's an intuitive method to observe structures.
  For instance, on public review platforms or property rental sites, map
  searches allow you to clearly sense the density of specific restaurants or
  properties in various districts, effectively presenting a "thermal map" of a
  particular aspect of a city.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'll introduce several general patterns:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  <strong>1)</strong> <strong>Inner Heat, Outer Cool</strong>: Every individual
  is warm inside and cool on the outside. Internally, adjacent particles or
  elements all generate heat. However, the skin or outer layer, which is exposed
  and has only one side neighboring the heat source, tends to cool down more
  rapidly. Cities follow a similar principle. Take New York's Manhattan for
  example: the borough is bounded by rivers on its east and west sides, and as
  you traverse from east to west, you cross avenues sequentially from First to
  Ninth. The First and Ninth Avenues are riverfronts, and while they offer
  beautiful views and certain areas, like near the western side of the World
  Financial Center (WFC), have been meticulously developed, none of these
  riverfront avenues is a major commercial hub. The bustling heart of Manhattan
  lies along the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Avenues – all situated centrally on
  the island.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The dynamics of urban activity demonstrate the 'Matthew effect' – areas with
  high activity or 'heat' tend to attract even more resources. As a result,
  central areas naturally have an advantage over the peripheries, an advantage
  that compounds over time. Hot areas get hotter, while cooler areas struggle to
  catch up.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  <strong>2) Boundary Vacuum</strong>: This concept, introduced by Jane Jacobs
  six decades ago, suggests that it's challenging to conduct commercial
  activities on the edges of spaces like parks or along riverbanks. The wider
  the river, the broader the road, or the larger the park, the harder it gets.
  Numerous attempts have been made to establish commercial streets along
  riverbanks, but most have not been very successful. For instance, while New
  York's Central Park is quite lively, the streets directly adjacent to it
  haven't developed into commercial zones. Fifth Avenue, which bustles with
  activity to the south, becomes subdued as it approaches the park,
  transitioning to a more residential ambiance. Main commercial districts in
  major world cities are typically not riverfronts. Overcoming the boundary
  vacuum to create bustling areas is a daunting task, with exceptions seen in
  places with traditional docks. Docks, being interfaces between water and city,
  attract resources and human traffic. Examples include Shanghai and Savannah.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  <strong>3) "Armpit Effect"</strong>: Observing the human body's surface
  temperature, you'll notice the armpits are warmer. This is because they are
  enclosed by the surrounding body, making them warmer than most external parts.
  Even though they are on the outside, they are surrounded by heat-generating
  points.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Drawing parallels in urban contexts, areas bordering internal and external
  spaces, due to their unique position, can become potential hubs of activity.
  The southeast and southwest corners of New York's Central Park serve as prime
  examples. Both points, with three sides surrounded by the city and one by the
  park, resemble the form of an armpit. Many people enter and exit the park
  through these locations, making them vital hubs of activity.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Locations resembling the "armpit" shape and situated next to water bodies are
  typically ideal spots for port cities, as they can draw from or radiate to
  vast land areas. The largest port city in the classical world, Corinth, was
  situated in such a semi-enclosed bay. Cities like Chicago, Genoa, Venice,
  Yingkou, and Trabzon in Turkey also occupy such 'armpit' positions. These
  locations witness a convergence of land-based traffic, akin to the
  concentration of major arteries and nerves in the human armpit region.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  4) <strong>Squeezing Effect</strong>. In the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the
  Inner City of Beijing had a massive block known as the Imperial City in the
  middle, which was impassable. From north to south, from Shichahai to the
  Southern Lake, there was an expansive ancient riverbed with limited bridges
  crossing it. Traffic from the north to the west largely squeezed through
  Yinding Bridge and Yandai Xiejie, forming bustling commercial streets. This
  bridge was also an essential route for the Regent Prince in the late Qing
  Dynasty, making it a frequent target for assassination attempts. This
  squeezing effect is common on bridges.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Near Beijing University, Tsinghua University, the Summer Palace, and the Old
  Summer Palace are massive enclosed blocks. This configuration has resulted in
  north-south traffic getting compressed between Zhongguancun North Street and
  Yuanmingyuan West Road, forming two roads with significant traffic.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In London's West End, traffic between Hyde Park and Buckingham Palace is also
  squeezed onto Knightsbridge Street. However, as previously mentioned, there's
  a boundary vacuum effect at the edge of large parks. Hence, commercial
  districts don't develop directly in these tight spots. Instead, they form on
  streets where the squeezing effect drives traffic into denser urban areas. For
  example, on Brompton Street, we find Harrods, the world's largest department
  store, and a bustling shopping district.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Traffic compression also occurs at city gates, station entrances, residential
  community entrances, school gates, and more.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  5) <strong>Nucleation Effect</strong>. Pure supersaturated steam won't
  condense on its own. It requires other particles with higher electronegativity
  to promote condensation. Similarly, homogeneous backgrounds like a vast
  Midwestern grid in the U.S., which is an extremely uniform structure, need
  some variations for cities to nucleate and grow. These variations might be the
  confluence of two rivers or a bridge over a river. New York's grid system is
  very uniform, but Broadway's diagonal crossing increases local road density,
  making these areas more conducive to the development of commercial districts.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  6) <strong>Environmental Induction Effect</strong>. On a colder day, when two
  people sit side by side, they can feel the side facing each other is warmer.
  Similarly, the warmth or conditions of the surrounding environment can
  influence a city's internal dynamics. The southern commercial area of Beijing
  during the Ming and Qing Dynasties was more significant than the north due to
  the more considerable population in the hinterland of the North China Plain.
  Similarly, the eastern commercial area of Xi'an was more significant than the
  west due to the larger population coming from the vast Guandong region.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  A city isn't isolated in a vacuum; its external "thermal" environment also
  determines its internal thermodynamic distribution. Jersey City in New Jersey,
  although separated by a river from Manhattan, also has its own downtown area
  at Journal Square. However, its upscale residential and business districts
  have developed along the river facing Manhattan. The convenience of accessing
  Manhattan is a crucial factor in determining property value.
</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In conclusion, this analysis using heat maps provides a dynamic method for
  understanding urban thermodynamics and how cities evolve and interact with
  their surroundings.

  这期，介绍一种分析方法。是对之前城市演化动力学进行的补充。首先稍微回顾一下之前的论述。这个系列第13讲，我把资源和技术流动的动力比喻为电势差，把交通因素比喻为导体。势差，是一地具备资源和技术，另一地缺少资源和技术，于是产生交流的需求。这种交流在实现的时候，会创造出价值。需要注意，势差不是由于距离产生的，而是由于不均质产生的。巴布亚新几内亚和刚果之间相距13000公里，两者之间几乎没有什么流动的需求，而清华大学和五道口相距几百米，之间流动的需求非常旺盛。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  人群，自身内部就能产生分工，产生不均质。资源和技术，很大程度上都是人。人就是资源和技术本身。所以，城市可以通过内部人的分工，凭空地产生很大的势差。大城市里，人们经常换着餐厅吃饭，今天吃意大利菜，明天吃泰国菜；而在村庄里，人更多自己在家吃饭。在大城市里，人上班一天，会坐不认识的司机开的车；发几十条电子邮件；和上百人合作；去不同的地方消费、娱乐。而村子里，每天也娱乐，都是去同一家和固定的几个人打麻将。人类聚落，符合网络效应。用户越多，价值越高。大城市内部产生的势差比村庄里大得多。势差越大，电阻越小，资源和技术流动的电流大，发出的功率也大。于是产生的财富更多，秩序更复杂。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  秩序更复杂，就会产生更精密的分工。产生更大的电势差。要产生一种分工，需要达到一定的体量。在这种体量下，才能产生足够的热度，才能爆发出特定的行业和特定的秩序。这与核爆炸的临界体积——critical
  mass——具有类似的原理。每个美国城市都有理发师，但是不一定都有日本料理。理发师和日本料理都属于比较通用的行业。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  而有一些更加特别的行业的秩序，需要在特定的层次上进行积累。不是单单对比人口。法兰克福比新德里小得多，但是金融业的电流强得多。横店比拉各斯小得多，但是影视业的电流强得多。普林斯顿比布宜诺斯艾利斯小得多，但是科学的电流强得多。城市内部的这种电流，是短距离的、多层次的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这一讲，我介绍城市研究中，被采用的另外一个类比方法，叫热力图。thermal
  map。你如果带上红外热成像仪，去看一个人。他身上热的地方就比较红，凉的地方比较绿。这就是热力图。城市研究者也用类似的工具，一般是给人口，或者特定地理信息画地图。用红色或者某种点来表示城市区域的热度。这是一种非常直观的观察结构的方法。大众点评或者租房网站的地图搜索上，你可以清晰地感觉到你所搜索的特定餐厅或者特定房源在各个地段上的密度。这就是表达特定城市侧面的一种热力图。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>我下面介绍几个一般规律：</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  1）第一个规律，每个人都是里面热，表皮凉。里面，相邻的质点都是发热的。而表皮只有一侧有发热的邻居，就比较容易凉下来。城市也一样。纽约曼哈顿东西两面临河，从东到西，依次是第一大道、第二大道，一直到第九大道。第一和第九是临河的，临河的景观肯定是不错的，而且有些地方，比如金融城西侧WFC附近，开发的也很用心。但是这些临河的街道没有哪个商业特别发达的。曼哈顿最热闹的大道是第五第六第七三条。都是在岛的中间位置。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  城市活动，存在马太效应。热度高的地方会得到更多的资源。所以中心相对于边界，一开始就具有优势，这种优势还会随时间积累。本来就热的地方越来越热，凉的地方不容易赶上来。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  2）上面这条规律反过来，就是第二个规律，叫边界真空。这是Jane
  Jacobs六十年前就归纳过的。公园的边界上或者河边上，绿化带边上。都是不容易进行商业经营的。河越宽、道路越宽、公园越大，就越难。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  有过很多想在河边搞商业街的尝试，多数不太成功。纽约的中央公园已经算很热闹的公园了，但是，与它直接相邻的街道都没发展成商业区。第五大道在南面一直是非常热闹的，北段到了公园边上，立刻就热闹不起来了，变成了居住区的氛围。世界大城市的主要商圈，基本没有临河的。对抗边界真空创造热点是非常困难的事情。除了在一些有传统码头的地方。码头，虽然一边临水，一边是城市，但是，水的一边带来了资源和人流。所以码头是一个特例。比如上海，比如萨凡纳。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  3）下一个规律，我称之为“腋窝效应”。你观察人体表皮的温度，你会发现其实他腋窝的地方温度是很高的，因为他周围被身体封闭着。他虽说是体外，但是附近发热的质点很多。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在城市上观察，体内和体外，这两种空间，他们之间的不均质，有可能产生一定的流动势能。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  纽约中央公园东南和西南两个角部，这两个路口，都是三面是城市，一角是公园。呈现腋窝的形态。很多人从这里进出公园。于是，这两个地点仍然体现出了很强的活力。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  处于腋窝的位置，如果体外的一边是水道，一般是一个好的港口城市的位置。这种港口可以汲取、或者辐射最大面积的陆地。古典世界最大的港口城市，科林斯，处在这样一个半封闭的海湾。芝加哥、热那亚、威尼斯、营口和土耳其的特拉布宗也是这种腋窝状的位置。腋窝位置上，会发生陆路交通的挤压。就好像连接人躯干和手臂的主动脉和神经，也集中在腋窝区域。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  4）这就是下一个规律，挤压效应。明清北京的内城，有皇城这样一个超大街区挡在中间，无法穿行。从北到南，从什刹海到南海，还纵观着宽阔的古河道，上面只有有限的桥梁。北部的东西向交通大量挤压在银锭桥和烟袋斜街。形成了繁荣的商街。这座桥也是清末摄政王上下班的必经之路，所以成了暗杀活动埋炸弹的案发现场。挤压效应，在桥上经常发生。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  北京大学、清华大学、颐和园和圆明园，都是封闭的超大街区。导致这附近南北向的交通，压缩在中关村北大街和圆明园西路，形成两条流量巨大的道路。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  伦敦西区，海德公园和白金汉宫之间的交通，也在Knightsbridge街发生挤压。但是，如我们之前所说，在大的公园的边缘，存在边界真空效应。所以商圈，并不在狭缝处发育。而是在越过狭缝，进入有一定密度的城区之后，挤压效应带动的街道上形成商圈。在Brompton街上，发育出全球最大的百货公司——哈罗德，和发达的商店街。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>交通压缩，也发生在，城门口，车站口，小区口，学校口等等。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>5）我介绍的第五种规律，我称为“变异凝结核”的规律。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  纯净的过饱和的水蒸气不会凝结。需要一些其他的颗粒，带有更大的电极性，促进凝结的发生。卤水点豆腐也是类似的情况。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在一个特别均质的背景上，A点和B点有什么区别，不知道。一筐土豆，无法产生秩序。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  美国广袤的中西部，无边无际的英里网格，是一种极为均质的结构。但是，存在一些变化，比如两条河流的交汇口，比如一个架桥过河的位置。这些位置会产生凝结，每个城市都是这样的一个小小的不均质形成的凝结。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  纽约的路网，是非常均质的路网，每个街区都非常相似。百老汇大街，斜着穿过这个路网，就提高了这些局部的路网的密度。这些局部更容易发育出商业区。洛克菲勒中心，有意地规划了更密的路网，提高了自身和附近街区的商业价值，也成为了城市设计史上的经典。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  6）我介绍的最后一个规律，称为“环境诱导效应”。在比较冷的天气，两个人并排坐着，可以感觉到靠近彼此的一边更暖和一些。朝向暖气的方向，比朝向冰冷的窗户的方向暖和。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>明清北京的南侧城关商业区的规模大于北侧。因为南侧华北平原腹地的人口更多。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  西安东侧城关商业区的规模大于西侧。因为和体量巨大的关东地区往来的人口规模更大。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  一个城市，并不是孤立于真空中，它的外部的热环境，也决定它内部的热力学分布。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  新泽西的泽西市，和曼哈顿岛一河之隔。它也有相当的体量，也有自己的市中心，在Journal
  Square。但是，泽西市的高级住宅区和商务区显然是朝向曼哈顿，沿河发育的，能方便登岛是决定地段价值的最重要方面。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>上面，就是对热力图，这样一个城市动力学分析方法的介绍。</p>
