<p>33 城市设计的语言（2）</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In this chapter, I continue with the discussion on the language of urban
  design.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Following the grid pattern, let's delve into another urban design lexicon:
  radial roads.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Perhaps the most iconic representation of radial roads is the roundabout
  centered on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, from which 12 straight streets
  radiate. Another famous example is from Rome, where from the Piazza del Popolo
  at the northern end of the ancient city, roads radiate southward in a trident
  shape. Worth noting are Zhongshan Square in Dalian and Zhongshan Square in
  Shenyang, which share similar designs.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  While grid patterns can be found almost everywhere, the design of radial roads
  isn't present in every city. It is quite an extraordinary design. Radial roads
  give a distinct sense of centrality. Often, this center is candidly
  highlighted by memorial structures like the Arc de Triomphe, grand statues of
  eminent personalities, or obelisks. This radial design often leaves a lasting
  impression on observers. Its tone is very artificial, deliberate, and
  ceremonious, evoking a sense of imperial grandeur.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  However, if we observe from a broader scale on a map, and zoom out to a
  certain extent, you'll notice that large cities like Beijing exhibit this
  radial pattern in their highway network. Numerous highways radiate outward,
  connecting to satellite towns and further distant cities. Even if the inner
  city uses a grid pattern, once you leave the traditional urban areas, roads
  break free from the grid constraints and head directly towards their
  destinations.

<!-- /wp:group -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Every city operates this way, maintaining direct routes to their primary
  surrounding destinations. Numerous cities, regardless of their size, each
  serve as the center of a radial road system, together forming a spider
  web-like transportation network. Naturally occurring radial road patterns
  often appear outside city gates. For example, outside many gates of Lucca,
  you'll see roads leading to the front-left, front-center, and front-right. In
  Beijing's Qianmen area to the south, many diagonal streets form a radial
  pattern.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Direct Connections</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Within a grid pattern, wherever you go, you're bound to make one or multiple
  right-angle turns; there are no diagonal shortcuts. In contrast, a radial road
  pattern is essentially a combination of direct routes to the center. As the
  saying goes, "All roads lead to Rome." Therefore, the design language of
  radial road networks largely draws inspiration from the inherent order where
  all places converge towards the center. Evidently, this trend is rooted in
  efficiency.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Radial road networks also produce other practical effects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Vista and Hunting Gardens</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Firstly, landmarks at the center facilitate navigation within the city. The 12
  straight roads radiating from the roundabout of the Arc de Triomphe imply that
  from each of these roads, one can view the Arc. This greatly aids in
  orientation. This radial design can also be seen in European gardens, where
  several or perhaps dozens of straight paths converge onto a circular clearing.
  Often, a pavilion or another marker is placed there.

<p>
  When hunters traverse the dark woods, it's easy to lose their sense of
  direction. However, as they cross these paths, they can spot distant markers,
  providing a sense of direction. This spatial sensation, where one can see a
  landmark at the end of a straight road from afar, is often utilized in urban
  design. This concept is termed "Vista."
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Secondly, from such central convergence points, one can oversee all the radial
  paths. In hunting gardens, deer move randomly amongst the trees. When a leader
  chases prey, they shouldn’t wander aimlessly. Instead, spotters positioned at
  these junctions can identify which sector the deer entered. Having multiple
  observation points in the woods makes it easier to locate prey and guide the
  leader towards the deer.
</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In cities, radial structures are rare, with prisons being the main example.

<p><strong>Prison Plan</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Prison cellblocks often comprise several straight corridors converging at a
  point where a guard sits, able to monitor all the hallways simultaneously.
  This greatly economizes on manpower.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Paris, before the 19th century, was a city often marred by revolution. The
  Paris we see today underwent transformation during Napoleon's reign,
  resembling a hunting garden or prison in its layout. Its well-developed radial
  boulevards are conducive for barricading individual blocks, making it easier
  to isolate and encircle any uprising masses.

<p><strong>Palladian Vista</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The functions described might be practical sources for the development of
  radial road networks. However, inspirations might also be drawn from stage set
  designs, like Palladio's work at the Olympic Theatre in Vicenza. Here,
  Palladio constructed a three-dimensional virtual city as a backdrop. The stage
  is positioned as if at the convergence of five streets, allowing audiences to
  view the mid and distant sceneries of the city. The concept of Vista is
  extensively explored on this stage. Stagecraft and other artistic works, in
  the past, played roles similar to today’s photographs, comics, films, and
  television, and they've had influence on urban or architectural design.

<p><strong>The Grand Manner, Rome, Versaille, Washington</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The urban design language of the radial road network is also referred to by an
  art historical term: "grand manner". The history of its formation as a design
  language isn't as ancient as we might imagine; it's primarily a modern
  phenomenon. It possibly began in 16th century Rome during the reign of Pope
  Sixtus V. He sought to reorganize the city quarters to restore governance and
  reaffirm the Church's authority. The renovation aimed to connect pilgrimage
  sites through direct avenues, intending Rome to be an imperial city. However,
  candidly speaking, the avenues initiated by the Church were merely over ten
  meters wide. In comparison, the endeavors of Mussolini, who expanded the road
  in front of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome to 30 meters, or Ceaușescu, who
  widened the boulevard in front of the Palace of the Parliament in Bucharest to
  90 meters, were far more aggressive, with each subsequent ruler exhibiting an
  exponential increase in autocracy.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  After 16th century Rome, the grand manner approach didn't flourish
  immediately. It took another century until the late 17th century, during the
  era of Louis XIV and the Palace of Versailles, for it to gain clearer
  expression. Versailles symbolized the absolutism in France. French lords, akin
  to Japanese lords during the Edo period or the feudal families in post-Qin
  China, were centralized around the monarch, weakening their ties to their
  subjects and territories. Versailles served as a tool to diminish the feudal
  rights of these lords. From a development perspective, since Versailles was in
  the suburbs and required limited redevelopment, the overall cost was not
  particularly high.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Surprisingly, the next imperial city to employ the grand manner was in 1791
  America. The French surveyor L'Enfant designed Washington, D.C., with a richly
  layered, well-ordered and radial road network. The radial avenues emanated
  primarily from the U.S. Capitol and the White House. These avenues were named
  after U.S. states: Pennsylvania Avenue, Massachusetts Avenue, Connecticut
  Avenue, and so on. These streets lead in all directions, symbolically
  connecting to various parts of the vast American states. Washington, D.C. can
  be described as a city filled with grandeur, symbolic meaning, and monuments
  that ooze patriotism.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  It's hard to overlook the stark contrast between the urban temperament of
  Washington, D.C., and New York City. New York stands as the practical, compact
  capital of the capitalist world, entirely dissimilar from Washington.
  Moreover, both cities frequently appear in films and TV, etching contrasting
  impressions of America in the minds of viewers. Which one truly represents
  American culture?
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  New York symbolizes the amalgamation of immigrants from around the world,
  minority groups, subcultures, and intellectuals, providing the United States
  with economic vigor and innovative prowess. In contrast, Washington, D.C.,
  stands as an affirmation of America's loyal warriors and patriots. It serves
  as a sacred site where the American spirit is revered almost religiously,
  advocating American exceptionalism and a martial ethos. These two cities
  epitomize the duality of America, and the nation couldn't thrive solely on one
  aspect.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The grand design of Washington, D.C., isn't necessarily linked to autocracy.
  After all, in 1791, the designated area for the capital was practically a
  blank slate, with a population smaller than nearby villages. There wasn't
  significant concern about how its streets should be laid out. The original
  landowners willingly donated the lands needed for the roads to the federal
  government, subsequently profiting from the appreciation in value of their
  remaining parcels. For its initial 100 years, the capital area consisted of
  only a few residences of officials near the White House and Capitol, as well
  as a handful of newspaper offices. Most didn't pay much attention to it, nor
  were they certain it would develop according to L'Enfant's original design.
  Today, it's hard to imagine that where the vast lawn in front of the Capitol
  stands, there were once railway tracks, and where the National Gallery of Art
  is located today, there used to be a train station where people boarded trains
  to Baltimore.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  It wasn't until 1902, with Congress's approval of the McMillan Plan, that the
  city's monumental nature, as envisioned in the original design, was not only
  preserved but also amplified. The Washington, D.C., we recognize today, as the
  ultimate embodiment of the "Grand Manner", emerged after another century had
  passed.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  During the interval we've discussed,
  <strong>Paris under Napoleon III</strong> underwent a Grand Manner
  redevelopment in the mid-to-late 19th century.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  From the perspective of emphasizing monumentality and nation-building, both
  Paris and Washington, D.C. stand out significantly. If not deemed outright
  successes, they are at least notable achievements that demand attention.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  If you argue that Paris succeeded, consider this: France, under the reigns of
  Louis XIV and Napoleon, was powerful enough to challenge the entirety of
  Europe. Yet, after the heroic/romantic immersion of Paris's grand projects,
  France found itself defeated by Prussia, previously a secondary power in
  Europe.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Some Technical Discussions on the Grand Manner</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Setting aside the aspect of monumentality and returning to the functional
  perspective of radiating road networks, a proper configuration can create
  <strong>shortcuts </strong>between urban destinations, potentially improving
  traffic efficiency. In the case of Paris, the grand boulevards functioned as
  the primary arteries of traffic, while the medieval street grid of Paris was
  largely relegated to serving as alleys or secondary roads, leading to a
  relatively clear traffic system.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In contrast, Washington, D.C.'s design <strong>superimposed </strong>radial
  roads onto a grid system similar to Chicago's. Each system would work
  efficiently on its own, but when combined with comparable widths, it becomes
  challenging to differentiate the primary from the secondary. Ideally, the
  radial boulevards would serve as main roads while the grid would act as
  secondary or tertiary routes. However, the radial boulevards in D.C. are often
  interrupted by roundabouts and parks, making the continuous grid more
  dominant. Furthermore, the streets of the grid system are quite wide,
  averaging about 27 meters. Such streets, especially in commercial areas,
  inevitably carry substantial traffic volumes. For instance, M Street and L
  Street in Northwest D.C. might seem like secondary roads on a map, but they
  experience higher traffic than nearby Vermont Avenue and New Hampshire Avenue.
  This results in an <strong>inversion </strong>of the intended
  <strong>hierarchy</strong>.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  This design has led to incredibly complex intersections and a plethora of
  one-way streets. Though the system might appear clear at first glance,
  numerous "patches" have been added over time to address practical issues,
  compromising its intuitiveness and introducing various traffic pitfalls. For
  drivers, especially those unfamiliar with the city, navigating Washington,
  D.C. can pose a significant challenge, showcasing the inherent problems with
  its road system.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Pattern of the Grand Manner's Diffusion</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Returning to the historical narrative, in both Europe and the Americas, the
  late 19th century saw rapid urban development due to the Industrial
  Revolution, a situation akin to China around the turn of the 2000s. With
  world-class capitals like Paris and Washington, D.C. as exemplary models,
  various cities during their expansion phases eagerly adopted the Grand Manner
  style. Barcelona, Marseille, Milan, Florence, and many other rapidly
  developing cities during this period, to varying degrees, incorporated
  elements of this approach, leaving clear historical imprints. However, the
  complexity of most European cities' environments meant there was limited space
  for grand-scale planning, resulting in a more restrained application of the
  Grand Manner style.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From this, <strong>several patterns</strong> can be discerned:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Firstly, as mentioned earlier, new cities more easily embraced the Grand
  Manner style, while older ones found it challenging.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Secondly, areas that didn't experience much economic growth in the 19th
  century, such as Venice and Siena, missed out on this trend and didn't witness
  the emergence of the Grand Manner.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Thirdly, the prominence of this style was influenced by cultural and political
  environments. Throughout the 19th century, the UK, which was leading the
  global order, had only subtle expressions of this architectural language. In
  contrast, "second-tier" powers that were challengers, like France, Italy, and
  Spain, displayed it more conspicuously. In countries like the Netherlands,
  Germany, and Switzerland, it was less evident.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  One could interpret these patterns from various angles. At a glance, regions
  where the Grand Manner was popular were predominantly Latin-speaking, while it
  seemed less favored in Germanic-speaking regions. It appeared more embraced in
  Catholic areas and less so in Protestant regions. A cursory observation might
  also suggest that areas with especially rapid economic growth in the late 19th
  century didn't favor it as much, while those with moderate growth did. The
  spread of architectural styles might be linked with language, cultural
  circles, and levels of economic development. However, some patterns don't
  entirely fit this mold.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  <strong>Economical and Political Foundations for the Grand Manner</strong>
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Logically, faster economic growth should provide more funds for large-scale
  urban construction. For instance, France's economy grew rapidly in the late
  19th century. Napoleon III's grand redevelopment of Paris, a top-tier
  international city, was among the most audacious of its kind. I believe a key
  reason for its success was that mid-19th-century Paris was in a prolonged
  period of peace, marked by economic growth and soaring real estate values -
  somewhat resembling modern-day China. There was a golden window when property
  prices were rising annually. If the government decided to demolish and rebuild
  an area, offering to compensate homeowners with half of the newly constructed
  space (which was three times larger), everyone benefitted. Within three years,
  property values might double, increasing a homeowner's assets threefold,
  without the government incurring losses. However, it remains debatable whether
  the increase in property value was directly linked to the government's
  redevelopment. During such times, profits are easily generated, and these
  profits could offset the costs incurred by massive demolitions and
  constructions.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  I hypothesize that rulers generally have an inclination towards the Grand
  Manner. However, in areas with well-preserved feudal traditions and freedoms,
  such as in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, the Grand Manner
  doesn't find much room to manifest. In contrast, in regions where feudal
  liberties are weaker or where the balance between rulers and the ruled is more
  unequal—including colonies like North America—the Grand Manner finds its
  expression, given there's sufficient economic surplus. I believe this provides
  a more reliable historical explanation.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The Spread to the Other Worlds</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Consider the 20th century. Western civilization continued its global spread.
  The radiating road networks and grand-scale planning, which couldn't fully
  manifest in the heartlands of Western civilization, shone brightly in its
  peripheries: New Delhi in India and Canberra in Australia became new bastions
  of the Grand Manner. Hence, I argue that the lack of popularity of the Grand
  Manner in mainland UK wasn't due to the British disliking it, nor was it
  strictly related to language or religion. It was simply harder to implement at
  home. In their colonies, where there were fewer restrictions, the British
  pursued it with gusto.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  These two cases, unsurprisingly, can be categorized under my list of
  experimental, resource-draining projects. Unlike the self-sustaining
  redevelopment of Paris, the developments in New Delhi and Canberra were purely
  financially draining. Beyond their grand scale and radiating patterns, they
  also adopted an anti-urban utopian style characteristic of early automobile
  suburbs. Even in their respective countries, these projects didn't necessarily
  garner high praise.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Perhaps, when economic constraints are minimal, there's a risk of frivolity,
  leading to less thoughtful urban planning.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In the 20th century, Japan, as an ardent admirer of Western civilization,
  continued to embrace urban designs that the West was starting to outgrow.
  Frankly, the Grand Manner wasn't easily applicable in mainland Japan, given
  its careful resource allocation. However, during Japan's imperial ventures in
  Northeast China, Japanese architects, influenced by Western culture, fervently
  implemented grand urban designs in cities like Shenyang, Anshan, and
  Changchun, leaving a legacy of roundabouts and radiating avenues.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In the core area of civilization, ideas and technologies coexist in a diverse,
  mixed, and relatively balanced state. Yet, the more radical, non-mainstream,
  idealistic, and experimental concepts, which might not dominate in the center,
  often find their most extreme expression on the peripheries.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  It's akin to how urban planning in modern China is currently influenced by the
  modernist ideals invented by the Western architects a century ago. This
  mirrors what Confucius said about traditions being sought in the wilderness
  when they fade in the center. The most traditional elements might get
  overshadowed in the heart of civilization but linger on its edges. These are
  two patterns of dissemination—structurally similar but directionally opposite.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>这期，我们继续讨论城市设计的语言。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>在方格网之后，我讨论一下城市设计的另外一种语汇，放射状道路。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  人们印象最深刻的放射状道路，可能是巴黎凯旋门为中心的那个环岛，从这个环岛放射出去12条街道笔直的街道。或者从罗马古城北端的人民广场Piazza
  del
  Popolo，向南辐射出去的三叉戟形状的道路。值得一提的是大连的中山广场和沈阳的中山广场也是类似的设计。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  如果说方格网几乎到处都是的话，那么，放射状道路的设计并非所有城市都有，是相当不平常的一种设计。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  放射状道路，具有很明确的中心感。有时候，就很直白的，放一些纪念性物体在这个中心点上。比如凯旋门、比如伟人的巨像，比如方尖碑。这种放射状的设计经常给人留下非常深刻的印象。其调子，非常人工、刻意、非常具有仪式感；给人一种皇皇帝都的印象。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  然而，如果我们观察大地上更大尺度的图片。如果你找一张地图，放缩到一定的尺寸，你会发现，北京这种大城市周边的高速公路网，就是呈现一种放射的形态。十几条高速公路通向所有方向上的卫星城和更远的城市。即便在城内是方格路网，一旦出了传统市区的范围，城市间道路就会脱离路网的束缚，朝向目标而去。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  而每一个城市，都是如此，和它们周边的主要目的地有相对比较直接的道路相连。许多大大小小的城市，各自是一组放射形道路的中心，共同构成一个蜘蛛网状的公路交通系统。自发的放射状路网，比较常出现在城门外。比如卢卡的很多城门外面，你都会看到通向左前，正前和右前的三条道路。北京的前门南面，也存在很多斜街组成的放射状路网。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在方格路网里，你去哪里都要拐一个或者若干直角弯，没有斜向的捷径。与之相对，放射状的路网就是通向中心的捷径的组合。条条大路通罗马。所以说，放射状路网，这种设计语言，也很大程度上取材于自发秩序里，各个地点向中心汇聚的这种自然的趋势，这种趋势显然也是以效率为基础的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>放射状的路网，还有其他的实际效果。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  第一，比如，通过中心位置的地标建筑，在城市里便于找路。从凯旋门的环岛放射出12条笔直的道路，换句话说，这12条道路上都能看到凯旋门。这样就很有助于形成方向感。我们也可以从欧洲园林中发现这种放射状的林间道路。几条或者十几条笔直的林间路汇聚在一个圆形的空地。那里会有一个亭子或者其他标记物。

  当猎手们穿行在幽暗的林间时，他们是不容易感受自己的位置的。但是，他们会是不是经过这些小路，这时候他们能看到远处的标记物，从而产生方向感。这种，从远处看到笔直道路尽头的地标的这种空间感，是城市设计中经常使用的语言，术语叫做Vista。

  第二，反过来，从这样一个中心的交汇点，可以观察到所有放射状道路上的情况。在狩猎园林中，鹿群是在林间随机运动的。领导提着枪追逐猎物的时候，你不能让领导像没头苍蝇一样在林子里乱追。这时候，安排人在交汇点观察，可以看到鹿群进入了哪个扇形区域，如果你在树林里有多个这种观察点，就更容易给猎物定位；便于引导领导找到鹿群。

<p>在城市里，放射状的建筑不多，最主要的只有一种，那就是监狱。</p>

  监狱牢房的几条笔直的走廊汇聚在一个点上，狱警坐在这里，可以同时监控所有的走廊。这样就可以大大地节约管理人力。

  19世纪之前的巴黎，是一个经常爆发革命的城市。而今天我们看到的巴黎，是经过了路易波拿巴王朝的改造，一个平面很像狩猎园林，或者监狱的城市。它有发达的放射形大道，这些大道有利于火力封锁城市里的一个个街块。便于对起义群众进行分割包围。

  应该说上面我讲的这些功能，都可能是放射状路网在现实中的素材来源。然而，它还可能从舞台布景当中吸取了营养。这就是帕拉迪奥的作品，维琴察的奥林匹克剧院。在这个剧院里，帕拉迪奥搭建了一个三维的虚拟的城市为背景的舞台，舞台所处的位置仿佛五条街道的交汇点，观众可以通过这些街道，看到城市的中景和远景。Vista的概念，在这个舞台上得到了很充分的发掘。舞台艺术和其他美术作品，在过去，起到今天照片、漫画、电影电视等媒介的作用，它们对城市设计或者建筑设计是存在影响的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这种放射状路网的城市设计语言，还被用一个艺术史术语来称呼，叫“grand manner"
  也就是大手法的意思。它做为设计语言成形的历史，没有我们想象的那么悠久。它主要还是一个近代现象。可能开始于16世纪的罗马，在教皇S西斯图斯五世主政时期；他通过对罗马市区进行整理，来恢复统治秩序，恢复教会的权威性。罗马的改造工程，希望能用直来直去的大道连接朝圣地点，使罗马成为皇皇帝都。不过，坦率说，教会开辟的这些大道，宽度才十米出头，这个工程的力度和后世的墨索里尼没法比，和齐奥塞斯库更加没法比。墨索里尼，可以把罗马圣彼得大教堂前的大道拓宽到30米，而齐奥塞斯库能把布加勒斯特共和宫前的大道拓宽到90米。这几者的专制程度是以几何级数依次提高的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在十六世纪的罗马之后，这种大手法并没有特别快的兴旺。过了一百年，到17世纪后期，路易十四时代的凡尔赛，才得到了更清晰的表达。凡尔赛，是法国绝对君主制的象征。法国的诸侯，像江户时代日本的诸侯，或者被秦灭亡后关东六国诸侯的家族一样，被集中到君主的身边居住。减弱他们和自己臣民、领地的关系。凡尔赛，就是削弱法国诸侯封建权利的一个工具。从工程建设的角度，凡尔赛是在郊区，做一些大动作、大构图，需要拆迁改造的工程有限，本身成本并不高。不能算一个非常勉强的项目。

  下一个使用大手法的帝都，有点意外，居然是在1791年的美国。法国裔测绘员L'Enfant，为华盛顿特区规划了，层次丰富、秩序井然的、放射状路网发达的城市总平面。放射状大道的从国会大厦和白宫两处为中心，散射开来。这些大道以美国各州名字命名：宾夕法尼亚大街、马萨诸塞大街、康涅迪格大街等等。这些大街，通向四面八方，意念中美国各州广大腹地的各处。华盛顿称得上一座，充满大手法、象征意义和纪念性，遍布爱国主义庙堂的煌煌帝都。。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  我们很难不注意到，华盛顿的城市气质和纽约的城市气质之间的巨大反差。纽约，是实用、紧凑的资本主义世界之都；和华盛顿毫不相似。而且，纽约和华盛顿都经常出现在影视作品里，于是，在人们的脑海里留下了关于美国的截然相反的印象。到底哪个更能代表美国的文化呢？
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  纽约代表了对全世界新移民、少数族裔、亚文化群体、知识分子的融合和统战，给美国提供经济动力和创新力。华盛顿，代表了对美国忠诚战士、爱国者的肯定，是把美国精神做为宗教来朝拜的圣地，鼓吹美国优越论和尚武精神。这两个城市，代表了美国的两面性，而且单靠其中一面是无法支撑这个帝国的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  华盛顿特区大手法的实施，和专制主义关系不大。毕竟，1791年的特区几乎是一张白纸，人口比附近的村镇还少。这上面的街道用什么格局布置，没有多少人真正关心。原来土地的所有者，非常痛快地把修路地土地赠送给了联邦政府。然后靠其他地块地增值大赚一笔。最初100年的特区，只是在白宫和国会附近的一些官员的住所和几家报馆。大家并不在意它、也不知道它是否会按照L'Enfant最初的设计发展下去。今天，人们很难想象，国会前的大草坪上，曾经横着一些铁轨，在今天国家美术馆的位置上，是一座火车站，去巴尔的摩的人在这里上车。

  直到1902年国会通过McMillan方案，才保障了、甚至是放大了原有规划的纪念性。这才是我们今天看到的Grand
  Manner的最大杰作的华盛顿。这中间又隔了100多年。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在这个时间间隔内，在十九世纪中后期，才出现了我们前面讨论过的拿破仑三世的巴黎。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  从强调纪念性，和民族建构的角度，巴黎和华盛顿，我们不说他们是成功的，至少也是效果显著，令人瞩目的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  如果你说巴黎成功，那么我们看，在路易十四和拿破仑时代可以吊打整个欧洲的法国；在巴黎大项目的爱国主义洗礼之后，被欧洲二流国家的普鲁士吊打。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  我们抛开纪念性。回到放射状路网的交通性能的角度上来审视。适当的配置，有利于在城市目的地之间形成捷径，有可能提高交通效率。以巴黎的情况看，这些大道，起到了交通动脉的作用，而巴黎中世纪的街道网，基本被降级为小巷，承担局部支路的作用。所以，巴黎改造的交通系统是相对清晰的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  而从华盛顿的情况看，他是在一个和芝加哥差不多的方格路网上叠加了放射状道路，这两个系统，单独以哪个为主工作都没什么问题。但是，这两个层次的路网，宽度接近，形成势均力敌的叠加，难以区别主次。本来，大道系统成为主路，方格网成为支路是可行的。但是，偏偏发射状大道经常被环岛和公园切断，而方格路网反而是连续的。而且方格路网的街道足够宽，一般在27米，在这样的街道，在商业区中必然会承载巨大的流量。比如华盛顿西北区的M街和L街，从图形上看属于次级街道，但是交通流超过了附近的弗蒙特大道和新罕布什尔大道。这就造成的等级的颠倒。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  造成了无比复杂多样的路口和单行道系统。这个系统，看似清晰，但是在解决实际问题时，打了很多补丁，不再具有直观性，产生了很多交通陷阱。给开车的人，特别不熟悉道路的人，造成了巨大的挑战。这就是华盛顿大道系统的问题。
</p>

  回到历史主线，在欧洲和美洲，19世纪后期，工业革命导致了城市的高速发展，状况和2000年前后的中国差不多。因为有了巴黎和华盛顿这两个世界级的首都做为不坏的榜样。各个城市在新城扩展阶段，热衷于采用Grand
  Manner的手法。巴塞罗那、马赛、米兰、佛罗伦萨，等等，只要在这个阶段发展比较快的城市，都或多或少的采用了类似的语言，留下了很清晰的历史的痕迹。只不过，绝大多数欧洲的城市的环境相对复杂，施展手脚的空间相对有限。所以大构图在这些城市也只是得到了有限的表达。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>这里面可以看出一些规律：</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  比如，其一，前面说了，新城比较容易用Grand
  manner，而老城比较难；其二，19世纪经济不怎么发展的地方，比如威尼斯、比如锡耶纳，它们就错过了这波，没有出现Grand
  manner；其三，和文化、和政治环境有关，我们看到，整个19世纪，主导世界秩序的英国本土，这类语言表达得特别微弱。而在法国、意大利、西班牙这些做为挑战者的次一等强国里，表现得相对明显。在荷兰、德国、瑞士又表现得比较弱。这个现象，可以进行不同角度的解释。从表面上看，Grand
  Manner吃香的地区似乎主要是拉丁语区域，而日耳曼语地区似乎不怎么吃香。似乎在天主教地区吃香，而在新教地区不吃香。似乎19世纪后期经济发展特别快的地方不吃香；经济发展中等的地方反而吃香。这是一个非常粗略的观测，一般，艺术风格的传播，确实和语言、文化圈子、经济发展水平都有关。但是有些也不太能说通。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>按说，经济发展得快，应该更有钱搞大手笔城市建设。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  比如法国19世纪后期的经济发展也是很快的。路易波拿巴在巴黎这种国际一线大城市搞改造，是大手笔里面最触目惊心的。能够搞成，我认为有一个重要原因是，19世纪中期的巴黎，正处在长期和平，经济发展和房地产升值的高峰。和今天中国有一点相似。这里面有一个窗口期，房价年年涨，政府出面把你们家拆迁了，盖3倍面积的新房，其中一半赔给你们家。工程干了三年，这时候房价翻翻了，你们家固定资产一下增加到3倍。政府自己也没赔本。大家都高兴。但是其实资产升值是不是和政府改造有关系？谁也不知道。在这种时代，总是容易产生收益，这些收益，足够弥补大拆大建的政府工程的消耗。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  我有一个假说，那就是，统治者其实都或多或少地倾向Grand
  Manner。只不过，在封建传统比较发达，封建自由保存得比较好得地区，比如英国、德国、荷兰、瑞士这些地方，Grand
  Manner不太容易施展开。在封建自由比较薄弱，或者说，在统治者和被统治者更不对等的地区，包括在殖民地，北美这些地方，能施展开地地方，只要有足够地经济发展剩余，Grand
  Manner有机会就会露头。这才是我认为比较靠谱一个历史解释方向。我们看看后来20世纪的情况。在20世纪前期，西方文明仍然在全世界扩散。在西方文明的中心地区不怎么施展得开的这种放射状路网，大构图。在西方文明传播的边缘的印度的新德里、澳大利亚的堪培拉，大放异彩。它们成为Grand
  Manner新的的两大帝都。所以我说，英国本土Grand
  Manner不吃香，不是因为英国人不喜欢，也不是真的和语言、宗教有关。而是他们在英国本土干不成。在殖民地，没人管得了他们，他们一样会干。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这两个案例，不出意外地，也被我列入消耗性、实验性项目的案例。它们和巴黎改造的差别是，巴黎是自负盈亏的，以经济可行为基础的。而新德里和堪培拉纯属财政消耗性的。除了大手笔，放射状之外，还具有了早期汽车郊区的反城市乌托邦风格。即便在它们本国，评价也不见得高。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>所以，经济上制约因素少了，可能反而轻佻浮躁，反而不能搞出好的城市规划。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在20世纪，紧随其后，日本，做为西方文明的重要粉丝，仍然在热情地传播这些在西方已经稍微落伍地城市设计。坦率讲，Grand
  Manner在日本本土也非常施展不开，毕竟日本本土有一个需要精打细算的国情在。但是在日本军事冒险家和开拓团开发东三省的时代，崇拜西方文化的日本建筑师，在沈阳、鞍山和长春也大干快上地搞出了一批大手笔都市设计，给这些城市留下了众多的环岛和放射状大道系统。

  在文明中心，思想和技术呈现多元、混杂、相对平衡的状态。而其中，比较激进、比较非主流、比较理想主义、比较实验性的东西，在中心有时候没有占据优势，反而往往在文明传播的外围得到最极致的表达。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这就好像，现在中国城市规划占据统治地位的东西，是西方左派20年代发明，在西方50年代最流行的现代主义一样。这和孔子说的，礼失求诸野，也就是说，最传统的东西，在文明中心被其他东西淹没了，但是在文明的边缘有所残留；是结构相同，方向相反的两种传播规律。
