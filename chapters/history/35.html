<p>35 Skyline as an Evolutionary Phenomenon</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The skyline of a city is an important part of a city's image and is therefore
  valued. In this chapter we discuss Skyline. It is first a natural phenomenon,
  then a phenomenon of urban evolution, and in modern times, it has sometimes
  become an object of design. Let me expand on the explanation below.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  What is a Skyline? The skyline is that dividing line between sky and earth at
  the end of the line of sight. If you are blocked by something very close and
  tall in front of you, you won't be able to see the skyline. Therefore, it is
  often several kilometers or tens of kilometers of empty space in between
  allowing one to see the typical skyline. All that drive to the downtown of
  Chicago, New York or Lujiazui from afar for the first time are well impressed
  by their skylines .
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The skyline of a city is valued by people because it can reveal a lot of
  information about the city. The power of a thing is often related to its
  volume. Tall things on the skyline are likely to reflect where the power is.

  城市的天际线，是城市形象的重要部分，因而受到重视。这期我们讨论一下天际线。它首先是自然现象，然后是城市的演化现象，在近代，有时还成为了设计的对象。下面我展开解释一下。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  什么是天际线？天际线是视线尽头天和地之间的那条分界线。如果你面前被很近很高的物体遮住视线，就无法看到天际线。所以，一般要隔着几公里、几十公里的空旷空间，才能看到典型的天际线。我想，如果你第一次从远方驶向芝加哥、纽约或者陆家嘴的市区，对他们的天际线的印象一定是是非常深刻的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  城市的天际线，之所以被人们所重视，是因为它能够揭示出关于城市的很多信息，一个事物的力量是和体量有关系的。天际线上高大的东西，很可能反应力量的所在。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在历史上，天际线，在很多情况下，在最漫长的时间里，其实是被山峰树木之类的自然物统治的，即便今天，自然物在有些城市的天际线上仍然醒目，东京、横滨的市区，在晴天可以看到富士山。波特兰市区，可以清楚地看到胡德火山。西雅图市区，可以看到雷尼尔火山；温哥华市区可以看到贝克火山。鹿儿岛市区则直接面对樱岛火山。这些体量巨大，突出于云层的山峰，很容易引起居民对自然的敬畏之情和对天地之道的思索。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>当然，我们今天看到的天际线，更多是人造建筑塑造的。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>这些人造天际线的层次，一向是政治的和敏感的。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在今天的中国农村，人们非常在意别人家的房子是否比自己高的。很多人盖房子的时候会悄悄超过隔壁的屋顶。这既是显性的攀比，也是一种社会巫术。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  所谓攀比，你可以认为是一种政治科学，屋脊的高低，可能暗示他家在社区中的地位；高的屋脊，导致他家的社会资本的增减；也可能导致他家今后的交易成本的降低，也就是说他家在做生意、嫁女儿的时候更容易得到别人的信任。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  所谓社会巫术，就是说，如果我房子比你低了，那么可能就会有一系列不好的事情发生在我身上。为了避免这些不幸，我一定要比你高一点才安心。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  今天的中国农村可以说是一个非常扁平的社会，在传统社会，身份认同更加重要。普通成员的房屋的高度，如果超过社区领袖、酋长、祭司的房屋的高度，是很破坏规矩的。是不可想象的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  日本战国时代的一些显赫的诸侯，被尊称为oyakata
  sama——御屋形样；显然，在日本社会，你家屋顶的形状和高度，应该能够反应你的社会位阶。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在传统村落中，一般而言，房屋组成的天际线不高，甚至不如林梢醒目，呈现相对柔和、含蓄的层次。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  而天际线上明显突出的元素，一般还是依靠市区内的山丘和地形的高点上来营造。也就是雅典卫城这类，漂浮于平原城镇之上一个城中城。往往是堡垒、神殿、金库、粮仓的综合体，在中世纪，经常是领主或者修道院的城堡。这种类型，因为在雅典、摩纳哥、爱丁堡、布达佩斯、萨尔茨堡、大阪这样的大城市里具有显性的表达，而为人们所熟知。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  日本诸侯，比如织田信长的岐阜城和安土城，均是在山顶建筑天守阁，和萨尔茨堡、爱丁堡并无不同。这种设定，并非地域性的，而是具有跨文化的普遍性。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  居住于山丘之上，一方面有利于防守，可以降低风险；另一方面，上山下山的交通和运输成本很高，有时候喝水打井都不容易。如果是农业或者工商业者，需要经常出入于道路或者农田，住在上山就显得成本太高。也因此，有条件居住于山顶城堡的，是王子、公主、寺院长老之类作为封建主和他们的从属人员。居住于山顶是一种特权。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In history, the skyline, in many cases, for the longest time, was actually
  dominated by natural objects such as mountains and trees. Even today, natural
  objects still stand out on the skylines of some cities. The cities of Tokyo
  and Yokohama area, you can see Mount Fuji on a clear day. In downtown
  Portland, you can clearly see Mount Hood. In downtown Seattle, you can see
  Mount Rainier; in downtown Vancouver, you can see Mount Baker. Kagoshima City
  directly faces Sakurajima Volcano. These huge peaks protruding from the clouds
  can easily arouse residents' awe of nature and thinking about the way of
  heaven and earth.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, the skyline we see today is more shaped by man-made buildings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The layers of these artificial skylines have always been political and
  sensitive.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In rural China today, people are very concerned about whether other people's
  houses are taller than their own. When many people build a house, they will
  sneak over the roof of the neighbor next door. This is both explicit
  comparison and social witchcraft.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The so-called comparison can be regarded as a kind of political science. The
  height of the roof may indicate the status of his family in the community; a
  high roof may increase or decrease the social capital of his family; This
  means that it is easier for his family to gain the trust of others when doing
  business and marrying their daughters.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The so-called social witchcraft means that if my house is lower than yours,
  then a series of bad things may happen to me. In order to avoid these
  misfortunes, I must be a little taller than you to be at ease.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Today's rural China can be said to be a very flat society. In traditional
  society, identity is more important. If the height of the houses of ordinary
  members exceeds the height of the houses of community leaders, chiefs, and
  priests, it is a violation of the rules. is unimaginable.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Some prominent vassals in the Warring States Period in Japan were honored as
  oyakata sama—宫屋形式; obviously, in Japanese society, the shape and height of
  your roof should be able to reflect your social rank.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In traditional villages, generally speaking, the skyline composed of houses is
  not high, not even as eye-catching as the forest tops, presenting a relatively
  soft and subtle level.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The prominent elements on the skyline are generally built on the hills and
  high points of the terrain in the urban area. That is to say, the Acropolis, a
  city within a city floating above the plain towns. It is often a complex of
  fortresses, temples, treasuries, granaries, and in the Middle Ages, often the
  castles of lords or monasteries. This type is known for its dominant
  expression in such large cities as Athens, Monaco, Edinburgh, Budapest,
  Salzburg, and Osaka.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Japanese princes, such as Oda Nobunaga's Gifu Castle and Azuchi Castle, built
  castle towers on the top of the mountain, no different from Salzburg and
  Edinburgh. This setting is not regional, but universal across cultures.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Living on the hills, on the one hand, is conducive to defense and can reduce
  risks; on the other hand, the transportation and transportation costs up and
  down the mountains are very high, and sometimes it is not easy to drink water
  and dig wells. If you are an agricultural or industrial or commercial person,
  you need to go in and out of roads or farmland frequently, and the cost of
  living in the mountains is too high. Therefore, it is the princes, princesses,
  temple elders and the like who are qualified to live in the hilltop castles as
  feudal lords and their subordinates. Living on top of a mountain is a
  privilege.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在平地城市，有些情况下，城墙、城门和望楼，这些防御工事可以构成天际线上最醒目的元素。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  城墙，做为城市的外皮，是搞形象工程的很合适的场所。破烂的城墙是会显得虚弱的。而高大的城墙，足以表现一个城市的财力和武备。所以，以城墙做为天际线主要元素的古代城市非常常见。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  它是一个文明现象。充满心机的统治者，对城墙、城楼进行的修饰，大大超出城防本身的需要。比如两河流域的古城，尼尼微、巴比伦，修筑的一些不成比例的高大楼台，用极为华丽的彩釉砖来装饰的城墙和城门，在今天仍然可以看到它们的，他们的华丽超过了城墙本身的需要。城墙上的楼台甚至成为观星、做法事等等神秘活动的场所。用这些活动向外国人，也向本国的被统治者来表达文治武功。这些皆是用来教化人心，引导秩序的硬件。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  修筑高大坚固的砖石建筑物，就可以永久性地支配天际线，建立一种千秋万代的秩序。埃及金字塔矗立4600多年，它的主人和那个文明已经逝去，但是你不能不说，它即使没有感动，也至少震撼、启发了几百代的人，今天仍然在荣耀着那一片土地。类似的永久性支配天际线的建筑物，我们可以在两河流域、在渭河谷地，在印度、斯里兰卡或者墨西哥看到。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这种构筑物的诀窍是，要呈现清晰的几何形状，如果不是棱锥，就如同南亚的很多巨大的佛塔，也需要是半球形，或者如日本古坟时代的陵墓一样，前圆后方。这样才能和自然界的山丘形成绝然的反差。不会被混同于自然物体。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In flat cities, in some cases, walls, gates and watchtowers, these
  fortifications can form the most striking elements of the skyline.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The city wall, as the outer skin of the city, is a very suitable place for
  image engineering. A dilapidated city wall will appear weak. The tall city
  walls are enough to show the financial strength and military equipment of a
  city. Therefore, ancient cities with city walls as the main element of the
  skyline are very common.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  It is a civilized phenomenon. The scheming ruler modified the city walls and
  towers far beyond the needs of the city defense itself. For example, in the
  ancient cities of Mesopotamia, Nineveh and Babylon, some disproportionately
  high towers were built, and the walls and gates decorated with extremely
  gorgeous glazed bricks can still be seen today. Their magnificence Beyond the
  needs of the walls themselves. The towers on the city wall have even become
  places for mysterious activities such as stargazing and performing rituals.
  Use these activities to express Wenzhiwugong to foreigners as well as to the
  ruled in the country. These are all hardware used to educate people and guide
  order.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Building tall and solid masonry buildings can permanently dominate the skyline
  and establish an order for generations to come. The Egyptian pyramid has stood
  for more than 4,600 years. Its owner and that civilization have passed away,
  but you have to say that even if it has not moved, it has at least shocked and
  inspired hundreds of generations of people, and it is still glorifying that
  land today. Similar buildings that permanently dominate the skyline can be
  seen in Mesopotamia, in the Wei River valley, in India, Sri Lanka or Mexico.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The trick of this kind of structure is to present a clear geometric shape. If
  it is not a pyramid, like many huge Buddhist pagodas in South Asia, it also
  needs to be hemispherical, or like the mausoleums of the Kofun era in Japan,
  the front is round and the back is round. Only in this way can it form an
  absolute contrast with the hills in nature. Not to be confused with natural
  objects.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  和这些大如山峰的纪念建筑相比。细高的塔，是一种更加主流，有意突出于天际线的纪念建筑。约旦境内出土的9000年前的古城里，就存在这种塔楼。据认为，它是用来呼唤农民去耕作出勤。中世纪教会的塔楼和亚洲的钟鼓楼，都整点敲响，向居民告知时间。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  伊斯兰传统城市的各级寺院，配有塔楼，宣礼塔，他们经常立在寺院的周围，一天五次，向四面八方呼唤社区居民进行参拜活动。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>所以塔楼作为一种秩序服务的器物，它提供的秩序最初是非常具体的。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Compared with these monumental buildings as big as mountains. The slender
  tower is a more mainstream monumental building that deliberately protrudes
  from the skyline. Such towers existed in the 9,000-year-old ancient city
  unearthed in Jordan. It is believed that it was used to call farmers to work.
  The towers of medieval churches and the bell and drum towers of Asia all
  strike the hour to tell the residents the time.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The temples at all levels in traditional Islamic cities are equipped with
  towers and minarets. They often stand around the temples and call community
  residents in all directions to worship five times a day.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Therefore, the tower is an object serving order, and the order it provides is
  initially very specific.
</p>

  12世纪之后，在欧洲，出现了特别高大的教堂。巴黎圣母院的塔尖高91米。科隆主教堂塔尖高157米。高度在两者之间个主教堂有一大批。这些超高塔楼，就超越了实用的范围。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  在电梯出现之前，城市里绝大多数房屋不会超过20米高；在那个时代，这些主教堂当然是鹤立鸡群，主宰着城市的天际线。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  除去主教堂之外，一个城市里还有多个社区教堂。兰恩爵士主持设计了伦敦五十多个教堂。这其中包括伦敦东区的主教堂圣保罗大教堂，而其余的多数是社区教堂。圣保罗大教堂的顶高110米，而其他几十座社区教堂的塔尖高度一般在30米到70米之间。配合着众多做为背景的十几米高的民居，这样，它们就共同构成一个典型的欧洲传统城市天际线。这个天际线秩序井然地表达了城市和社区两级的组织机构。一个城市的主教堂，除去荣耀上帝的初衷之外，也体现了这个城市的财富、政治信用和艺术水准。如同每个社区的教堂，也代表了该社区的财富和声望，它的背后是一些行会和布尔乔亚家庭。所有人，都希望自己的社区和城市的教堂的辉煌是和他们的财富和声望是相配的，甚至是有所夸耀的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  After the 12th century, in Europe, particularly tall churches appeared. The
  spire of Notre Dame de Paris is 91 meters high. The spire of Cologne Cathedral
  is 157 meters high. There are a large number of main churches in the height
  between the two. These ultra-high towers are beyond the scope of practicality.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Before elevators, the vast majority of houses in cities were no more than 20
  meters high; in those days, of course, these cathedrals stood out and
  dominated the city skyline.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In addition to the main church, there are several community churches in a
  city. Sir Lane presided over the design of more than fifty churches in London.
  This includes St Paul's Cathedral, the main church in the East End, while most
  of the rest are community churches. The top of St. Paul's Cathedral is 110
  meters high, while the spiers of dozens of other community churches are
  generally between 30 and 70 meters high. Cooperating with many residential
  buildings with a height of more than ten meters as the background, they
  together form a typical European traditional city skyline. This skyline is an
  orderly expression of organization at both the city and community levels. A
  city's cathedral, apart from its original intention of glorifying God, also
  reflects the city's wealth, political reputation and artistic level. Like the
  church in every community, it also represented the wealth and prestige of that
  community, behind it were some guilds and bourgeois families. All people hope
  that the splendor of their communities and city churches will match their
  wealth and prestige, and even boast of it.

<p>
  所以，传统城市的天际线，是一个多层次竞争的系统。没有统一的安排，却能相当准确的表达市民社团之间的实力和雄心的强弱对比。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>除去宗教团体建造这些改变天际线的地标，世俗政权也建造高大的地标建筑。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  托斯卡纳地区中世纪的名城锡耶纳坐落在一片丘陵的顶部，主教堂在最高的山丘顶上。这个位置，早在9世纪就已经被教堂占据了。12世纪修建的钟塔高度七十米左右。锡耶纳共和国12世纪成立，比教会晚来了400年，没有占到山顶的位置。到14世纪，在半山腰的位置建起市政厅，它的地面海拔高度比主教堂矮了30米，为了能够表达政权和教权平等的理念，它的钟楼反而要造的更高，达到102米，这样它的顶部和主教堂的塔楼刚好平齐，它们就构成了锡耶纳天际线上的两个高点。同时它也成为了中世纪第二高的世俗建筑。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这个的高度，一是不僭越教会的权威；二是要超过城市里其他的塔楼。当时的锡耶纳比现在多很多塔楼，不止锡耶纳，在博洛尼亚、圣吉米亚诺、卢卡，都是如此，城区内塔楼林立，这些塔楼属于土豪家族。这些塔楼是townhouse的一种特殊表达。我们知道，英国地主，除去在家乡的庄园之外，经常在伦敦同时会买一座townhouse。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  意大利土豪并非不同，土豪家族一般拥有乡村大农庄，主要收入也来自于这些农庄，但是同时，他们也在城里会有一处房子，城里的房子比较紧凑，符合townhouse的概念。城市是土豪们参与商业活动和政治活动的场所。那个时代，国家机器弱小，缺乏警察和大包大揽的司法制度。和金庸武侠差不多，土豪安全需要自理，土豪如果被另一个土豪杀了，它只能靠自己的子孙去报仇。每个土豪家族在漫长的跨代的发展中，都积累自己的盟友和敌人，存在持续的低烈度战争。所以他们的townhouse的表现形式和伦敦大大的不同，体现为堡垒塔楼的形式。这里面保护自己家族的要人，存放金银之外，有时也囚禁敌人。这些塔楼，一般高度从二三十米到八九十米不等。超过一定高度之后，这种塔楼在军事上的收益就不大，但是，只要不失礼节，每家都希望能尽量高一点，以做为他们家族表达财富和声望的手段。也就是说，每个家族都是在设计自己的塔楼在城市天际线上的呈现。此外，这些塔楼的分布也不是随机的、松散的。他们基本都在城市的主路边上，处于价值较高的、同时在城市中存在感更高的地段上。它们和特朗普总统给他的那些大厦选择地段和进行设计时候的考量并无不同。
</p>

<p>
  Therefore, the skyline of a traditional city is a system of multi-level
  competition. There is no unified arrangement, but it can quite accurately
  express the strength and ambition of civic associations.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In addition to religious groups building these skyline-altering landmarks,
  secular regimes also build tall landmark buildings.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Siena, a famous medieval city in Tuscany, is located on the top of a hill, and
  the main church is on the top of the highest hill. This position was already
  occupied by a church as early as the 9th century. The bell tower built in the
  12th century is about 70 meters high. The Republic of Siena was established in
  the 12th century, 400 years later than the church, and did not occupy the top
  of the mountain. By the 14th century, the city hall was built on the
  mountainside. Its ground altitude was 30 meters lower than that of the main
  church. In order to express the idea of equality of political power and
  religious power, its bell tower had to be built even higher, reaching 102
  meters. meters so that its top is exactly level with the towers of the
  cathedral, and they form the two high points on the Siena skyline. It also
  became the second tallest secular building in the Middle Ages.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The height of this tower, on the one hand, does not overstep the authority of
  the church; on the other hand, it surpasses other towers in the city. Siena at
  that time had many more towers than it does now, not only in Siena, but also
  in Bologna, San Gimignano, and Lucca. There were many towers in the city, and
  these towers belonged to rich families. These towers are a special expression
  of the townhouse. We know that British landowners, apart from the manor in
  their hometown, often buy a townhouse in London at the same time.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Local tyrants in Italy are not different. Local tyrants generally own large
  farms in the countryside, and their main income comes from these farms. But at
  the same time, they also have a house in the city. The house in the city is
  relatively compact, which fits the concept of a townhouse. The city is the
  place where local tyrants participate in business activities and political
  activities. At that time, the state apparatus was weak, lacking the police and
  a comprehensive judicial system. Similar to Jin Yong's martial arts, a local
  tyrant needs to take care of his own safety. If a local tyrant is killed by
  another local tyrant, he can only rely on his own descendants to avenge. In
  the long intergenerational development of each local tyrant family, they have
  accumulated their own allies and enemies, and there are continuous
  low-intensity wars. Therefore, the expression form of their townhouse is very
  different from that of London, which is reflected in the form of a fortress
  tower. It protects the dignitaries of one's own family, stores gold and
  silver, and sometimes imprisons enemies. These towers generally range in
  height from twenty to thirty meters to eighty or ninety meters. After a
  certain height, the military benefits of this kind of tower are not great, but
  as long as the etiquette is not lost, every family hopes to be as high as
  possible, as a means of expressing their wealth and prestige. In other words,
  each family is designing its own presentation of the tower on the city
  skyline. In addition, the distribution of these towers is not random and
  loose. They are basically on the main roadside of the city, in locations with
  higher value and a higher sense of presence in the city. They are not
  dissimilar to the considerations in the location and design of the towers that
  President Trump gave him.

  我们看，在前工业时代，存在过这些土豪的塔楼，他们在一部分城市的天际线上，和教会和政府的建筑构成过竞争，但是，当时在世界上多数城市里支配天际线的，主要还是由类似城墙城楼、教会钟塔、政府大厦之类纪念碑建筑。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  然而，进入工业时代之后，民间商业机构、盈利性机构继承了古代土豪的角色，并且，它们确实在很多地方做到了压倒教会和政府，成为高层建筑的主要建设者，确实改变了城市的天际线，颠覆了原来的秩序。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这些商业化的高层建筑的建设活动在世界上一部分城市，不受限制，或者受到很少的限制，得到了比较自由的表达。在新兴商业城市中，比如纽约、香港；在传统商业城市中，比如法兰克福，比如伦敦的部分区域。在这些城市，我们目力所及的主要是商业机构修建和占据的高楼大厦。

  美国国会早期的召集地在纽约曼哈顿下城华尔街26号，现在，这里有一个二十几米高，立面庄严如同巴特农神庙，内部有一个穹顶犹如罗马万神殿的建筑。它目前是旧联邦议会的纪念馆。是在1842年在原址上改建的。在当时，显然是一个相对高大、相对醒目的建筑。但是，今天，它被众多金融机构的摩天大楼包围，隔壁紧邻着，只隔了一个两三米宽的施工缝，就是283米高的曼哈顿信托银行大厦。相比之下，它看起来好像一个菜市场一样的平房。去华尔街的游客，几乎不会注意它。这种做法相当于把上海中心贴在一大会址上。所以说纽约体现的就是所谓资本的”野蛮扩张“。香港也是类似，港英政府的建筑，在中环的各种摩天大楼的阴影中，处于一种肉眼不可见的状态。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  纽约的政府当局，也有过想改变天际线来突出公权力的尝试，那就是1909年开工的曼哈顿市政大厦，34层，主体高106米，塔顶高170米。在当时也是曼哈顿最高的大厦之一。但是，不出三十年，这个建筑被曼哈顿下城各种更高的建筑淹没，仅仅实现了若隐若现的存在。

  We can see that in the pre-industrial era, there were towers of these local
  tyrants, and they competed with church and government buildings on the skyline
  of some cities. However, at that time, the skylines of most cities in the
  world were dominated by It consists of monuments such as city walls, towers,

  However, after entering the industrial age, private commercial organizations

  tyrants, and they have indeed overwhelmed churches and governments in many
  places, becoming the main builders of high-rise buildings, and indeed changing
  the city's skyline , subverting the original order.

  The construction activities of these commercial high-rise buildings are not
  restricted, or are subject to few restrictions, and have been relatively
  freely expressed in some cities in the world. In emerging commercial cities,
  such as New York and Hong Kong; in traditional commercial cities, such as
  Frankfurt, such as parts of London. In these cities, what we see are mainly
  high-rise buildings built and occupied by commercial institutions.

  The early meeting place of the U.S. Congress was at No. 26 Wall Street in
  Lower Manhattan, New York. Now, there is a building more than 20 meters high,
  with a majestic facade like the Parthenon, and a dome like the Roman Pantheon
  inside. It is currently a memorial to the old Federal Parliament. It was
  rebuilt on the original site in 1842. At that time, it was obviously a
  relatively tall and eye-catching building. However, today, it is surrounded by
  skyscrapers of many financial institutions, next to it is only a two or three
  meter wide construction joint, the 283-meter-high Manhattan Trust Bank
  Building. In contrast, it looks like a bungalow like a vegetable market.
  Tourists to Wall Street hardly notice it. This approach is equivalent to
  pasting the Shanghai Center on the site of a large conference. So what New
  York embodies is the so-called "barbaric expansion" of capital. Hong Kong is
  similar. The buildings of the Hong Kong British government are in a state of
  being invisible to the naked eye in the shadow of various skyscrapers in
  Central.

  The government authorities in New York have also tried to change the skyline
  to highlight public power. That is the Manhattan Municipal Building, which
  started construction in 1909. It has 34 floors, the main body is 106 meters
  high, and the top of the tower is 170 meters high. It was one of the tallest
  buildings in Manhattan at the time. However, within thirty years, the building
  was overwhelmed by the taller buildings in lower Manhattan, only realizing a
  looming existence.

  盐湖城摩门教的神殿，也努力建的高大庄严，但是，它同样被相邻的商业建筑包裹，高度也被它们超过。

  美国式的CBD体现了自由放任的经济政策环境下，同时也是相对自由的城市公共政策环境下城市的天际线就会呈现的状态。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  但是如果说自由放任就会出现高层建筑群的CBD，那也想太美了。离开盐湖城的市中心一公里，城市的天际线上就再难找到高大的建筑，只剩下无边无际的独栋住宅。皇后区和曼哈顿只隔着一条河，但是高层建筑只有那么一点。更多的是几层、十几层的中等密度街区。东京都市圈，规模之大，密度之高，所产生的高层建筑群也只是丸之内、新宿西口、汐留之类几个小片，无边无际的是密密麻麻的独户小住宅上点缀着十几层、二十几层高的公寓楼和一些商业街。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  也就是说，在自由放任的经济政策环境下，产生的建筑，仍然是6成的低矮房屋，3成的中等高度房屋，加上1成不到的高层建筑，而且，高层房屋会非常集中。这样的图案。在不同的地区有所差异，但是大概符合这样一个分布。

  其实自由放任的经济政策下的秩序，比专制主义的秩序还清楚，还斩钉截铁。那就是土地的价值，包括商业价值和居住价值，它们会直接决定这块土地上建筑的类型。

  城市土地价值的波函数的参数发生了剧烈的变化。但是人的认知能力还没有跟上，人们只会看到波函数在一些零散的点上坍缩留下足迹，从1900年代开始，在纽约，人寿保险大厦、帝国大厦、克莱斯勒大厦、洛克菲勒中心，东一个西一个，好像杂乱无章；但是100年过去了，在纽约很清晰的形成了中城和金融区两大坨的高层建筑，天际线上看相当的清晰。而且，这种坍缩还在进行中。每10年，纽约都还会涌现若干座300米以上的超高层建筑。他们都在揭示着全球化商业社会的秩序，并且其出现也影响着秩序。

  当然，公众并不都喜欢这样的天际线，公权力有时候也是如此。在当代，市场的自发秩序和公众观念、文化习俗之间的冲突，也表现在天际线的发展、变化、表现为对天际线管理的态度上。我以后有机会再进行讨论。

  The Mormon Temple in Salt Lake City also strives to be tall and solemn, but it
  is also wrapped by adjacent commercial buildings, and its height is also
  surpassed by them.

  The American-style CBD embodies the state of the city's skyline under a
  laissez-faire economic policy environment and a relatively free urban public
  policy environment.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  But if the CBD of high-rise buildings will appear if laissez-faire, it would
  be too beautiful. One kilometer away from the center of Salt Lake City, it is
  difficult to find tall buildings on the city skyline, leaving only endless
  single-family houses. Queens and Manhattan are only separated by a river, but
  there are only so many high-rise buildings. Most of them are medium-density
  blocks with several or more than ten floors. The Tokyo metropolitan area has a
  large scale and high density. The high-rise buildings produced are only a few
  small pieces such as Marunouchi, Shinjuku West Exit, and Shiodome. A
  dozen-storey apartment buildings and some commercial streets.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  That is to say, under the environment of laissez-faire economic policies, the
  resulting buildings are still 60% low-rise buildings, 30% medium-height
  buildings, and less than 10% high-rise buildings. Moreover, high-rise
  buildings will be very concentrated . Such a pattern. There are differences in
  different regions, but it roughly conforms to such a distribution.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In fact, the order under the laissez-faire economic policy is clearer and more
  resolute than the order of despotism. That is the value of land, including
  commercial value and residential value, which will directly determine the type
  of building on this land.

  The so-called barbaric growth of the city skyline. It does not mean that there
  is no order, but that the order is not as good as some people wish.

  The parameters of the wave function of urban land values change drastically.
  But people's cognitive ability has not kept up with it. People will only see
  the wave function collapsed at some scattered points and leave footprints.
  Since the 1900s, in New York, the Life Insurance Building, the Empire State
  Building, the Chrysler Building, and the Rockefeller Center, One in the east
  and the other in the west, it seems to be disorganized; but 100 years later,
  in New York, two large high-rise buildings in the Midtown and the financial
  district have been clearly formed, and the skyline is quite clear. Moreover,
  this collapse is still in progress. Every 10 years, there will be several
  super high-rise buildings over 300 meters in New York. All of them are
  revealing the order of the global commercial society, and their emergence also
  affects the order.

  Of course, the public doesn’t always like such skylines, and so do public
  authorities sometimes. In the contemporary era, the conflict between the
  spontaneous order of the market and public perceptions and cultural customs is
  also manifested in the development and changes of the skyline, manifested in
  the attitude towards skyline management. I'll have a chance to discuss that
  later.
