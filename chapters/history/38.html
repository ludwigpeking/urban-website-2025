<p>38 形态学——乡土、经典和当代类型在城市的比例感</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In this section, we will explore another perspective on urban morphology, one
  that doesn’t hinge heavily on complex theories but is rather intuitive.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Classical and Venecular</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  We can broadly categorize the buildings within a city into two groups through
  a straightforward observation. The first category encompasses majestic,
  authoritative buildings adorned with cultural symbols; examples include the
  Tiananmen Gate Tower, the Hall of Prayer in the Temple of Heaven, and the
  People's Congress Building in Beijing, as well as St. Paul’s Cathedral and the
  Westminster Palace in London.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The second category consists of more humble, pragmatic structures designed
  primarily for functionality. Examples of this type include the cave dwellings
  in Shaanxi, stilt houses in Hunan, fishing villages along the Ligurian coast,
  various courtyard houses worldwide, the industrial buildings in Beijing’s 798
  Art Zone, residential areas in Fangzhuang and the Asian Games Village,
  warehouses along the Chicago River, and residential complexes in Hachioji,
  Tokyo. We can also extend this category to include more temporary structures,
  such as the tent stalls at festivals around the world.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  I refer to the first, more grandiose category as "classical architecture" and
  the second, more practical type as "vernacular architecture." The method of
  observing a city that I’m introducing involves analyzing its history, social
  structure, and wealth level based on the proportion of these two types of
  architecture present.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  It might be noted that my use of the terms "classical" and "vernacular"
  architecture may not align with their conventional definitions. Indeed, my
  discourse extends from the works of Luxembourg architect Leon Krier. I have
  adopted his terminology - ‘Classical Architecture’ and ‘Vernacular
  Architecture’ - and generalized their definitions to cover a broader timespan
  in the city's evolutionary history, making these concepts applicable to the
  analysis of contemporary architecture.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Through this lens, the proportion and presence of these two architectural
  styles within a city can offer profound insights into the city’s historical
  progression, social stratification, and economic status. This dual-category
  perspective presents a simplified yet insightful lens for assessing urban
  development and the underlying forces that shape it.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Classical architecture in a narrower sense, denotes structures reminiscent of
  ancient temples, halls, and monuments. However, from a morphological
  perspective, the essence of classical architecture lies in its conceptual
  nature. It is crafted to flaunt the prestige of its owners and augment their
  authority. Thus, classical buildings are not confined to ancient times.
  Consequently, the opposite of classical architecture isn't modern or
  contemporary architecture but rather vernacular architecture.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Vernacular architecture in a narrower sense, refers to the indigenous and
  native building styles of a particular region. Think of wooden structured
  homes in Swiss villages or the cave dwellings on the Loess Plateau. These
  structures are characterized by their use of local materials and their
  adaptability to the regional climate – temperature, sunlight, precipitation –
  built by local craftsmen, exuding an air of practicality and simplicity. When
  we expand the definition of vernacular architecture, it transcends rural
  constructions and encapsulates straightforward, utility-driven urban
  structures like average homes, factories, warehouses, and shops. These
  structures, unconcerned with prestige or authority and unaimed at promoting
  specific cultural or conceptual narratives, embody the spirit of vernacular
  architecture. (Indeed, vernacular buildings are a treasure trove in
  architectural studies.) Even the modern, technologically intensive, and
  refined high-rise residences at the mouth of the Sumida River in Tokyo are
  built on principles of cost-efficiency and functionality without attempting to
  convey conceptual significances. Thus, morphologically, they share a
  structural homology with pre-industrial vernacular architecture.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In this context, we have laid out the morphological definitions of classical
  and vernacular architectures.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  This series has consistently explored the three primary forces shaping cities:
  defense, economy, and ideology. The defensive aspect, prioritizing the
  protection of life and property rights, is exemplified in structures like city
  walls, enclosures, fortresses, and security systems. We'll set aside this
  foundational element for now. The remaining two cornerstones, economy and
  ideology, are embodied in vernacular and classical architecture, respectively.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>the Proportion in History</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Looking back through history, vernacular architecture predates its classical
  counterpart, a testament to its pervasive presence since antiquity. In the
  initial stages of human civilization, when survival was a grueling task,
  economic surplus for architectural embellishment and ostentation was scarce.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Materials employed in construction were typically sourced from the immediate
  environment. Tree bark was processed into ropes and used for roofing to offer
  waterproofing, branches were crafted into beams, pillars, rafters, and
  purlins, and mud was used as filler or shaped into adobe bricks. The
  architectural sophistication at this stage was rudimentary, akin to the humble
  straw house of the first little pig in the classic tale.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In this scenario, architectural manifestations are primary, driven by the
  direct need for shelter and security, absent of elaborate aesthetic or
  symbolic concerns. The built environment emerges as a direct response to
  immediate, tangible needs, with no room for the luxury of conceptual or
  aesthetic embellishments.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The earliest human groups, or Bands, consisted of a dozen or at most, a few
  dozens who were related by blood. There were essentially no outsiders to whom
  wealth could be flaunted. However, as these small kin groups coalesced into
  tribes, there emerged a need for leadership to unify actions and consolidate
  power, necessitating elements that signified order and hierarchy. In the midst
  of early settlements constructed of the first little pig’s caliber of houses,
  order spontaneously manifested in the form of larger dwellings for elders and
  the emergence of shrines.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  The chief’s thatched home would often feature decorated roofs and eaves.
  Sometimes, it was intentionally built taller or placed on an elevated
  platform. The entrance gate would often be grand and imposing. Inside the
  chief's large house, mysterious or valuable items would be displayed. Shrines
  would receive similar treatment. The seer would often live in seclusion to
  minimize exposing his or her human facets. The seer’s house would often be
  encased within a square courtyard, with strict restrictions on the entry of
  ordinary people.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Beyond the architecture of the living, there were structures for the deceased,
  or for divine beings; totem poles or cairns expressed a collective myth of a
  people. This marked the inception of what would evolve into classical
  architecture. Even much later, the golden tents of the Great Khan of Mongolia,
  or some wooden churches in Northern Europe, largely remained at this stage.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Monumental structures like the pyramids or the Karnak Temple constructed in
  ancient Egypt, despite enduring thousands of years of weathering, have stood
  the test of time.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Yet, the most enduring and widespread influence in classical architecture can
  be traced back to the forms left by the ancient Greeks and Romans from the 5th
  century BC to the 5th century AD.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Initially, the temples of ancient Greece resembled the second little pig’s
  wooden structure – a phase that left behind no lasting structures. However, by
  the 5th century BC, the Greeks had entered the “third little pig” phase,
  constructing a plethora of temples primarily from stone, elevating the
  prestige and durability of this architectural form. This style of classical
  architecture, coupled with Greek knowledge and technology, was widely emulated
  throughout Western Europe and the Mediterranean and reached as far as Central
  Asia and Britain.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  During its proliferation, constant innovations were introduced, especially by
  the ancient Romans, who incorporated the arch and dome techniques in brick and
  stone construction. Buildings grew taller, spans wider, and spaces more
  expansive. New materials like red brick, hollow bricks, and concrete were
  employed, giving rise to a plethora of classical architectural types. These
  included, but were not limited to, temples, theaters, council halls, arenas,
  race tracks, palaces, tower structures, and bath centers - a comprehensive
  suite of public edifices that formed the archetype of classical architecture
  in the narrow sense.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  These archetypes were widely replicated over an extensive period across a
  significant portion of the world.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  This marked a global homage to, and identification with, the philosophical,
  scientific, and political ideals of the Greco-Roman classical world within the
  Western hemisphere and its influenced regions.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  As Western civilization spread its influence through globalization,
  architectural practices worldwide felt its impact. In China, a phenomenon
  emerged, evidenced by the so-called "County Town White House" and similar
  structures in villages and towns. (<em
    >*"County Town White House" refers to a phenomenon in China where local
    administrative buildings, often in smaller cities and towns, are constructed
    in a grand, Western classical architectural style reminiscent of the Capitol
    in Washington, D.C., as the public misidentify the Capitol with the White
    House.)
  </em>
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Japan and South Korea, too, saw the rise of highly Western classical
  architectural examples, evident in structures like their national assembly
  buildings.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Yet, every culture steeped in robust traditions boasts its distinct classic
  architectural styles. The domes of mosques, the onion domes of Orthodox
  churches, and the grand roofs characteristic of traditional Chinese
  architecture, each echo the rich cultural heritage from which they arise.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Vernacular architecture, however, is less a reflection of cultural
  inclinations and more an adaptation to the available materials and climatic
  conditions of a particular location. The stone-walled residences of Taihang
  Mountains share more similarities with those atop Laoshan Mountains than with
  the adobe brick homes nestled at the foot of Taihang. In another hemisphere,
  the gassho-zukuri farmhouses of Japan’s Shirakawa-go mirror the architectural
  essence of Swiss homes, yet diverge starkly from the residences sprawling
  across the Nobi Plain below.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>the Mosaic</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In the mosaic of a city’s architecture, the pattern formed by the intertwining
  of classical and vernacular buildings unveils distinct identities.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>1) All Vernacular</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  A common assumption often leads us to believe that rural areas are bastions of
  vernacular architecture, every structure a testament to simplicity and
  functionality. However, the reality of a 100% vernacular landscape is
  peculiar, if not uncanny.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Nature abhors a vacuum and also despises utter flatness in structure. A
  biological community devoid of a food chain is unfathomable. In the same vein,
  a universe composed solely of hydrogen atoms, due to gravity, will inevitably
  birth disparities in density. These higher density pockets trigger nuclear
  reactions, begetting a diversity of atoms and complex chemical structures.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Villages, products of evolutionary processes, are not homogenous entities. The
  anomaly of uniform villages is often the offspring of human planning. One
  might observe this in the military barracks of the Ming dynasty or in some of
  the newly constructed rural areas in Northern China, where each household is
  allocated an identical courtyard and house. This artificial, granular society
  is an aberration from the natural order, likened by philosophers to a basket
  of potatoes or a stretch of sandy soil.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Yet, even in this engineered uniformity, diversity seeks its expression.
  Absent the heavy hand of external enforcement, the building behaviours of
  individual households introduce an element of non-uniformity. Some expand
  their homes to two stories, others adorn their facades with ornately patterned
  ceramic tiles, and yet others crown their roofs with gourd-shaped spires.
  Hence, while the village retains a level of pronounced homogeneity, elements
  of conceptuality and endeavours towards classicism subtly permeate the
  landscape.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>2) Predominantly Vernacular</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  A more commonplace scenario mirrors the villages in Shanxi, where the bulk of
  the architecture is modest and utilitarian, akin to the quadrangle dwellings
  typical of vernacular design. Yet, complexity emerges: the main houses of
  affluent families boast opulent decorations, and within the village's
  confines, ancestral halls or temples of classic design stand as silent
  sentinels, bearing testimonies and transmitting ideologies. Occasional stages,
  funded by the affluent, not only host entertaining performances but also serve
  as platforms for moral and ethical edification, embodying societal norms. In
  this milieu, classical architecture subtly weaves its narrative amid the
  vernacular, forging a harmonious, stable design fabric.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>3) A Harmonious, Stable State</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  In several autonomous towns across Europe, classical architecture finds a more
  pronounced voice. Beyond churches, palaces, and theatres, edifices like
  schools, financial institutions, courthouses, and even cemeteries contribute
  to the city’s classic architectural ensemble. Classical structures, commanding
  up to 10% or more of the cityscape, often overshadow the more numerous
  vernacular buildings. This dominance is a hallmark of developed societies,
  reflecting stages of evolution marked by stability and maturity.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>4) Highly Classical: Imperial Capitals - London, Paris</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  There exist cities, like London and Paris, and once Rome, where classical
  architecture reigns supreme. The majority of structures are not just elegant
  but are imbued with a grandeur and commemorative essence. These cities are the
  products of enduring stability, economic affluence, and colossal wealth
  accumulation, often spanning two centuries or more. The maintenance of these
  classical edifices demands substantial resources, drawing from vast
  territories and populations.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Such cities of heightened classicism are typically the nuclei of imperial
  systems, sustained by the influx of resources from expansive hinterlands.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  While London and Paris exhibit a semblance of balance, Rome, in the twilight
  years of the empire, was a city of extravagant grandeur, where palaces and
  temples proliferated.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  However, this heightened classicism teeters on the edge of instability. Every
  city lures a influx of proletarians, prompting a demand for low-cost
  housing—vernacular architecture fills this gap. Absent the working class, a
  city cannot curtail its cost of living nor maintain long-term competitiveness.
  A city wholly gentrified is a transient illusion; a city maintained by bread
  and circuses, solely dedicated to consumption, can only exist in fragments.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>这期，我来介绍另外一个看待城市的形态学视角。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>不需要特别复杂的理论，通过直觉我们就能分出城市中的建筑大体分成两类。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  第一类是庄严的、有权威感的、带有文化符号的建筑：比如北京的天安门城楼、天坛祈年殿、人民大会堂；比如伦敦的圣保罗大教堂和威斯敏斯特国会；
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  第二类，是朴素、直来直去、追求实用的建筑，比如陕西的窑洞、湖南的吊脚楼、意大利海边的渔村、遍及世界的各种四合院民居；比如，北京东郊798的厂房，方庄或者亚运村的住宅区；芝加哥河边的仓库，东京八王子的住宅团地等等；（还有更加简易，更加临时的比如全世界节日市集的帐篷摊位；）
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  前一类，庄严的，有纪念性的，我称之为经典建筑；后一类，朴素的，实用的，我称之为乡土建筑。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  本期要介绍的观察城市的方法，就是，我们可以通过这两大类建筑在城市里的比例来分析这个城市的历史、社会结构和财富水平。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  可能有人说，我对这两个词的用法和他们的原始定义不一样。确实如此，我的这套论述延申自卢森堡建筑师Leon
  Krier，我借用了他的‘经典建筑’ Classical Architecture 和‘乡土建筑’ Vernacular
  Architecture的用法。并且，对它们的定义进行一般化，扩展到城市演化史的更长时间周期上，让这一对概念可以覆盖对当代建筑的分析。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  经典classical又可以叫古典建筑，狭义的说是指那些看起来像古典的神庙、殿堂、纪念碑样式的建筑。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  但是，从形态学的角度上，经典建筑的要害在于观念性，是用于炫耀其主人的声望，提高权威而建造。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  所有，他们不限于古代的。也因此，和经典建筑相对的，并不是现代当代建筑，而是乡土建筑。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  乡土建筑，狭义的说是指本乡本土的建筑。典型的是我们理解的瑞士山村的木结构房屋，或者黄土高原的窑洞。它们的特点是使用的本地的材料、符合本地气候，比如气温、日照、降雨，因地制宜，一般由本地工匠建造。把乡土建筑的定义进行推广，它就不再限于村里的建筑了。一般的朴素的民居、工厂、仓库、商店等等，只要是追求实用，要求经济、高效，不强调声望和权威，也不追求推动特定的文化或者观念的建筑，都符合乡土建筑的精神。（乡土建筑是建筑学的真正宝库。）东京隅田川入海处的超高层住宅，即使是现代的，即使是技术密集的，即使是精致的，但是它们都是以追求成本低、效率高的原则建造的，它们不试图表达特别具有观念性的东西，所以，它们从形态学的角度，和前工业时代的乡土建筑具有同构性。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>如上，就是形态角度上对经典建筑和乡土建筑的定义。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2）历史</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>这个系列一直围绕着城市的三大组织力量展开：防卫性、经济性和观念性。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  其中，保护生存和财产权的防卫性是第一性，体现为城墙、围墙、堡垒、门禁等等。排除这第一个基石不谈。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  其他两个基石，是经济性和观念性。乡土建筑和经典建筑，就分别是经济性和观念性的物质载体。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  回顾城市的历史，乡土建筑比经典建筑当然更古老、更普遍。最开始，人类筚路蓝缕，艰难生存的阶段，通常没有很多的经济剩余来对建筑进行装饰或者夸耀。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  它们能够使用的材料，就是栖居地附近触手可及的材料。树皮加工为麻绳和屋顶的防水，树枝加工为梁、柱、檩条和龙骨，泥土做成填充物或者土坯砖。基本属于三只小猪里面第一只的建筑水平。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  最初的人类群体Band，是一个十几人，最多三五十人的血缘共同体，因此也没有什么外人可以用来去炫耀财富。但是，小族群结合成的部落甫一形成，就需要凝聚力量、统一行动的领导力，需要一些标识秩序和阶级的要素。在大量第一只小猪的房子组成的早期聚落里，自发的产生的秩序，是长老的大屋和神社的出现。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  族长的茅屋的屋顶，和屋檐会进行装饰。有时候故意修建得高大一些，有时会被放在高台上。经常入口大门会修得高大气派。族长的大屋里会摆放神秘或者贵重的物品。神社也可能进行类似的处理，此外巫师和深居简出，以减少暴露他作为人的一面。巫师的房屋，经常被方形的院墙包围。普通人进出院子受到严格的限制。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  除去活人的建筑，还有死去的人的建筑，或者神灵的建筑；图腾柱或者敖包表达一些人群的共同神话。这就是经典建筑的草创形式。直到很久之后，蒙古大汗的金色大帐，或者北欧的一些木质教堂，很大程度上还是停留在这个阶段。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  古埃及建造的各种纪念建筑，比如金字塔或者卡纳克神庙，规模巨大，经历了几千年的风化生存至今。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  但是，真正影响最为长久广泛的经典建筑，是古希腊和古罗马人在从公元前5世纪，到公元后5世纪这不到一千年之间留下的建筑形式。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  最初，古希腊人的神庙最多也就是第二只小猪的状态，主要是木结构建筑。木结构的建筑是留不下来的。在公元前5世纪开始，古希腊人进入第三只小猪的阶段，大批建造用石材作为主要材料的神殿，提高了这种建筑类型的声望和耐久度。这类经典建筑随着希腊人的知识和技术在西欧和地中海地区得到广泛的模仿，传播范围远及中亚和不列颠。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这些技术在传播过程中，不断得到创新，主要在古罗马人的手里，结合了砖石建筑的拱圈、穹顶技术，建筑更高、跨度更大、空间更开阔，使用了红砖、空心砖和混凝土等新材料，形成了一大批经典建筑类型。包括而不限于，庙堂、剧场、议会大厅、竞技场、赛车场、宫殿、塔楼、洗浴中心等等全系列的经典公共建筑。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>它们形成了狭义的经典建筑的原型。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>这些原型，在很长时间内，在全世界很大范围，被大量的模仿。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这是西方世界和它们影响的地区表达对希腊罗马古典世界的哲学、科学思想和政治生活的崇尚和认祖归宗。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  随着西方文明的传播和全球化，影响了全世界很多地方的建筑实践。在中国出现了所谓"县城白宫"，村镇白宫的建筑现象。也出现了日本、韩国的国会大厦这些高度西洋古典化的建筑实践。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  然而，所有有坚固传统的文化都有它们自己的经典建筑。我们可以看出清真寺的穹顶、东正教的洋葱顶和中式大屋顶，大体是属于什么文化的。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  而乡土建筑，与其说顺应文化，不如说顺应所在地的材料和气候。太行山上的用毛石砌墙的民居，和远在崂山上的民居之间的相似度，远远大于和太行山下平原上用土坯砖的民居之间。日本飞駞高山的合掌造民居，和万里之外瑞士的民居看起来比较接近，但是和山下浓尾平原的民居并不接近。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>一个城市里经典建筑和乡土建筑的组合图案是不同的：</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1）全乡土。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>我们有时候简单的认为，在乡间，就100%全部都是乡土建筑。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>其实，100%的乡土建筑的情况反而是相当的怪异。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>自然届不存在完全扁平的结构，不可能有生物群落而没有食物链。</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  氢原子构成的原始宇宙会因为重力而产生密度的不均质，高密度的局部会发生热核反应，然后就会演化出多种原子和更复杂的化学结构。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  演化产生的村落总来都不是均质的。而均质的村落，缺居然只存在于人为规划中。或者明代卫所兵营之中或者华北的一些新农村中，每家每户都是一样大的院落和房子。这种人造的散沙社会反而是不自然的。哲学家称之为一筐土豆，或者一带沙土。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  这样的村落会自发的产生不均质。在没有外力强行进行的控制的的情况下，村内各家各户的建设行为会产生不均质，有的人家把房子增建到两层，有人用华丽图案的瓷砖装饰门面，有人子屋顶上装上葫芦形尖顶。这样，村庄虽然仍然是高度均质化的。其中还是或多或少地出现了一些观念性元素，出现了一些经典化的努力。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2）乡土为主</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  比较正常的形态是山西乡间那种村落，大体是朴素实用的四合院，属于乡土类型。但是，在大户人家的正房的门头带有华丽的装饰。在村庄里，有宗社和或者寺庙，带有纪念性，是传播观念的经典建筑类型；有一两处戏台，土豪赞助戏台的娱乐活动，同时具有类似大众媒体的道德教育功能；社会规范形成的组织设施。在乡土建筑之中，经典建筑有含蓄的表达，并且形成了相对稳定的形制。
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3）相对稳定和谐的状态</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

  在一些欧洲的自治市镇，经典建筑的发展更加充分。除去教堂、宫殿、剧院之外，学校、金融机构、法院、公墓之类也经常构成城市中的经典建筑。经典建筑在城市中占据10%甚至更大的比例，甚至压倒了为数更多的乡土建筑的风头。这是发达社会的一种特点。上面的这两种状态，可以说，都是比较稳定的状态。代表发展的不同阶段。

<p>4）高度经典化：帝都——伦敦、巴黎</p>

  世界上也存在高度经典化的城市，比如伦敦、巴黎，比如曾经的罗马。多数的房子都体面、华丽。甚至伟岸而充满纪念性。

  这是长期的稳定、经济发展和巨大财富积累的结果。经常是在200年甚至更久。而且，经典建筑，能够维持它的功能，是需要消耗大量资源的。一般需要从很大范围里汲取资源。

<p>所以，高度经典化城市，依靠的是帝国体制，和广阔腹地的资源输入。</p>

  如果说，伦敦和巴黎还算比较平衡，那么罗马，在帝国末年，是一种三步一宫殿，五步一神庙的状态了。

  这种高度经典化的城市本身也是不稳定的，任何城市都会吸引无产者的涌入，无产者的涌入要求更低成本的住房。这些低成本的住房就构成乡土建筑类型的填充。如果没有劳工阶层，城市也无法控制其生产生活的成本，也就无法长期维持竞争力。全面士绅化的城市是虚假和短暂的。面包与竞技维持的纯粹消费性城市只能是局部的。
